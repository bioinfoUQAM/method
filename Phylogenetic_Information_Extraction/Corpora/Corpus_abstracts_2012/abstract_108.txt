Rubella virus strains were isolated on Vero cells from the suspected patients' specimens collected in Zhejiang province during 2005 to 2010. Partial fragments of the structural gene of Zhejiang rubella strains were amplified, using nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The amplified products were sequences and analyzed.
