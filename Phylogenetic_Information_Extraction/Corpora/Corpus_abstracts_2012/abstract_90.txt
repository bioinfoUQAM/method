BACKGROUND: In 2004, HIV-1 infection among Taiwanese injection drug users (IDUs) started to surge. In 2007, a resurgence of HIV-1 epidemic among men having sex with men (MSM) occurred. We conducted a molecular epidemiological study of HIV-1 among different risk groups in Taiwan from 2005 to 2008. METHODS: In total 1,133 HIV-1-infected adults including 576 IDUs, 464 MSM and 93 heterosexuals were recruited. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using nested multiplex PCR and phylogenetic analysis. Dual infection was confirmed using cloning, sequencing and heteroduplex mobility assay. RESULTS: Among HIV-1/AIDS subjects, 96.1% MSM and 62.5% heterosexual males were infected with subtype B, while 66.7% female heterosexuals were infected with CRF01_AE. Most IDUs (84.5%) were infected with CRF07_BC. Four heterosexual males, two females and two MSM who were not IDUs had CRF07_BC. Forty-nine patients had CRF07_BC/subtype B dual infection and 44 (89.8%) were IDUs. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the odds ratio for dual infection among IDUs who shared syringes > 5 times per month was 4.7 (95% CI = 1.3 - 17.7). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that there were two main groups of CRF07_BC strains with sporadic transmission between different risk groups. Among 10 IDUs infected with CRF01_AE, 7 cases were clustered with an outbreak happened in 2005 and 3 cases were clustered with other strains from heterosexual population. CONCLUSIONS: In Taiwan, 7.8% of HIV-1-infected IDUs had dual infection. It may have important impact to their clinical management. Although CRF07_BC was still remained in IDUs, it has spread to MSM and heterosexual populations.
