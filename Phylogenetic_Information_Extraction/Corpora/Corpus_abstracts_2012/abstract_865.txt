"Among the leguminous trees natives to Uruguay Parapiptadenia rigida (Angico), a Mimosoideae legume, is one of the most promising species for agroforestry. Like many other legumes, it is able to establish symbiotic associations with rhizobia and belongs to the group known as ""Nitrogen Fixing Trees"", which are major components of agroforestry systems. Information about rhizobial symbionts for this genus is scarce, and thus the aim of this work was to identify and characterize rhizobia associated with P. rigida. A collection of Angico-nodulating isolates was obtained and 47 isolates were selected for genetic studies. According to ERIC-PCR patterns and RFLP analysis of their nifH and 16S rRNA genes, the isolates could be grouped into seven genotypes, including the genera Burkholderia, Cupriavidus and Rhizobium, amongst which the Burkholderia genotypes were the predominant group. Phylogenetic studies of nifH, nodA and nodC sequences from the Burkholderia and the Cupriavidus isolates indicated a close relationship of these genes with those from Beta-rhizobia rather than from Alpha-rhizobia. In addition, nodulation assays with representative isolates showed that whilst the Cupriavidus isolates were able to effectively nodulate Mimosa pudica, the Burkholderia isolates produced white and ineffective nodules on this host."
