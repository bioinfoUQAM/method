An aerobic, halotolerant, Gram-negative bacterium was isolated from the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius, and subjected to taxonomic characterization. The strain, designated KMM 6042T, was rod-shaped, motile and yellow-pigmented. The phylogenetic analysis results indicated that the strain was mostly related to the type strain of Altererythrobacter dongtanensis, and the level of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between the two was 99.0%. However, the DNA-DNA relatedness between the two strains was 34.4O7.6%. Physiological and chemotaxonomic properties clearly distinguished the strain from other species of Altererythrobacter. It is thus evident from the phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses that KMM 6042T merits recognition of a new species of Altererythrobacter, for which the name Altererythrobacter troitsensis sp. nov. (type strain = KMM 6042T = KCTC 12303T = JCM 17037T) is proposed.
