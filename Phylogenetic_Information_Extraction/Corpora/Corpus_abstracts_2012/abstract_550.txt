"The comparative structure of bacterial communities among closely related host species remains relatively unexplored. For instance, as speciation events progress from incipient to complete stages, does divergence in the composition of the species' microbial communities parallel the divergence of host nuclear genes? To address this question, we used the recently diverged species of the parasitoid wasp genus_Nasonia_to test whether the evolutionary relationships of their bacterial microbiotas recapitulate the_Nasonia_phylogenetic history. We also assessed microbial diversity in_Nasonia_at different stages of development to determine the role that host age plays in microbiota structure. The results indicate that all three species of_Nasonia_share simple larval microbiotas dominated by the _-proteobacteria class; however, bacterial species diversity increases as_Nasonia_develop into pupae and adults. Finally, under identical environmental conditions, the relationships of the microbial communities reflect the phylogeny of the_Nasonia_host species at multiple developmental stages, which suggests that the structure of an animal's microbial community is closely allied with divergence of host genes. These findings highlight the importance of host evolutionary relationships on microbiota composition and have broad implications for future studies of microbial symbiosis and animal speciation."
