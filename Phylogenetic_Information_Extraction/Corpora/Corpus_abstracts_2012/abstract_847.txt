A Gram-type positive, non-motile, psychrophilic actinobacterium, designated Cr8-25T, was isolated from alpine glacier cryoconite and was able to grow well over a temperature range of 1-15 'C. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain Cr8-25T belonged to the family Microbacteriaceae and showed highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Klugiella xanthotipulae 44C3T (97.0 %). However, strain Cr8-25T was differentiated from the type strain of K. xanthotipulae on the level of genomospecies by a DNA-DNA relatedness of only 37.2 %. Strain Cr8-25T contained a peptidoglycan cross-linked according to the B-type which is based on 2,4-diaminobutyric acid. The cell wall contained the sugars galactose, fucose and rhamnose. The predominant cellular fatty acids of strain Cr8-25T were C15:0 anteiso (64.6 %) and iso-C16:0 (22.5 %) and the major menaquinones were MK-11 and MK-10. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and unknown glycolipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 58.8 mol%. On the basis of the phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic analyses and DNA-DNA relatedness data, strain Cr8-25T represents a novel species of a new genus in the family Microbacteriaceae, for which the name Alpinimonas psychrophila is proposed. The type strain is Cr8-25T (=DSM 23737T = LMG 26215T).
