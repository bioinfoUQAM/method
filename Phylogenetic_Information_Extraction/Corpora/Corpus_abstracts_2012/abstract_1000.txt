Estimation of the distribution of selection coef_cients of mutations is a long-standing is- sue in molecular evolution. In addition to population-based methods, the distribution can be estimated from DNA sequence data by phylogenetic-based models. Previous models have generally found unimodal distributions where the probability mass is concentrated between mildly deleterious to nearly neutral mutations. Here we use a site-wise mutation-selection phylogenetic model to estimate the distribution of selection coef_cients among novel and _xed mutations (substitutions) in a data set of 244 mammalian mitochondrial genomes and a set of 401 PB2 proteins from influenza. We _nd a bimodal distribution of selection coef_cients for novel mutations in both the mitochondrial dataset and for the influenza protein evolving in its natural reservoir, birds. Most of the mutations are strongly deleterious with the rest of the probability mass concentrated around mildly deleterious to neutral mutations. The distribution of the coef_cients among substitutions is unimodal and symmetrical around nearly neutral substitutions for both data sets at adaptive equilibrium. About 0.5% of the non-synonymous mutations and 14% of the non-synonymous substitutions in the mitochondrial proteins are advantageous, with 0.5% and 24% observed for the influenza protein. Following a host shift of influenza from birds to humans, however, we _nd among novel mutations in PB2 a trimodal distribution with a small mode of advantageous mutations.
