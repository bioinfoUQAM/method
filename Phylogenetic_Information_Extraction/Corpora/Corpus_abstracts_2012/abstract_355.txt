"A novel Gram-negative strain, designated as 6.2ST, was isolated from a soil sample and identified as a biosurfactant producer. Its taxonomic position was investigated using a polyphasic approach. The cells were non-motile, non-spore-forming rods. The organism grew optimally at 30-37'C, with 0-3% NaCl, and at pH 7.0. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain 6.2ST was found to be a member of the genus Sphingobacterium and is most closely related to four type species of the genus, showing sequence similarities of 96.8-98.9%. Partial chaperonin 60 (cpn60) gene sequence analysis was useful in resolving phylogenetic relationships between strain 6.2ST and closely related taxa, with similarities ranging from 85.5% (with S. thalpophilum DSM 11723T) to 90.3% (with S. canadense CR11T and S. multivorum JCM 21156T). Furthermore, the results of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments were clearly lower than 70% DNA-DNA similarity, and consequently confirmed that this new strain does not belong to a previously described species of the genus Sphingobacterium. The major fatty acids were summed feature 3 (iso- C15:0 2 OH and/or C16:1 w7c) (43.71%); iso-C15:0 (20.91%); iso-C17:0 3-OH (7.40%) and C16:0 (7.33%). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 40.0 mol%. According to its phenotypic and genotypic characteristics and phylogenetic data, strain 6.2ST represents a novel species of the genus Sphingobacterium, for which the name Sphingobacterium detergens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 6.2ST (= CECT 7938T = LMG 26465T)."
