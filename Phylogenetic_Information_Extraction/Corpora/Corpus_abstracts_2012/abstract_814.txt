Analysis of sequences (n = 30) of a hypervariable segment (599 bp) of the mtDNA control region in raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides Gray, 1834, introduced into the Upper Volga basin, revealed a high level of molecular genetic variation. Two statistically significantly different haplogroups were identified. These haplogroups, however, were not associated with spatial geographic structure of the population. Phylogenetic patterns of the introduced population were associated with probable heterogeneity of autochthonous donor populations with respect to relatively large group of founders and a dramatic increase in the species number after the introduction.
