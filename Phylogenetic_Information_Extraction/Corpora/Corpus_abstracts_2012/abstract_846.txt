A novel actinobacterium, designated strain YIM 100590T, was isolated from Panthera tigris amoyensis feces collected from Yunnan Wild Animal Park in Yunnan province, south-west China. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data showed that strain YIM 100590T is a member of the family Micrococcaceae. Its cells were coccoid to oval (0.7-1.5 Em in diameter) singly or in cluster. Growth was observed in the temperature range between 10-37'C (optimum 28'C) and pH 7.0-11.0 (optimum pH 8.0). The major fatty acids were iso-C15:0 (32.22%), anteiso-C15:0 (31.64%) and iso-C16:0 (17.38%). The peptidoglycan type was A4a, L-Lys-Gly-L-Glu. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidyl inositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIM), dimannosyldiacylglycerol (DMDG), unknown glycolipid (GL) and 2 unknown phospholipids (PLs). The predominant menaquinones were MK-7 (91.9%) and MK-8 (8.3%). The DNA G+C content was 56.2 mol%. All chemotaxonomic data indicated that the strain belongs to the family Micrococcaceae. On the basis of morphological, chemotaxonomic data and phylogenetic analysis, strain YIM 100590T is considered to represent a novel species of a novel genus within the family Micrococcaceae, for which the name Enteroactinococcus coprophilus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 100590T (=DSM 24083T =JCM 17352T). Yaniella fodinae DSM 22966T was transfered into the new genus, and named Enteroactinococcus fodinae comb. nov.
