Fifteen genera and eight possible new species of actinobacteria were identified. Members of 3 genera were not isolated from marine habitats before. Of the 280 strains 21% and 20% inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus lentus, respectively. More than 75% of the strains exhibited 8 types of enzymatic activities, including esterase lipase (C8), catalase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase.
