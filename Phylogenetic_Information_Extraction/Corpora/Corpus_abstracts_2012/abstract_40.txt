Circadian rhythms are regulated by an internal clock, which is itself synchronized to environmental cues such as light and temperature. It is widely assumed that the circadian system is adapted to local cues, which vary enormously across habitats, yet the comparative data necessary for testing this idea are lacking. We examined photic and thermal resetting of the circadian clock in five species of Anolis lizards whose microhabitats differ in the amounts of sun and shade. The primary circadian oscillator in Anolis is the pineal gland, which produces the hormone melatonin. A flow-through culture system was employed to measure rhythmic melatonin output from individually cultured pineal glands. All species showed temperature-compensated circadian rhythms of pineal melatonin. Light caused significant phase delays of the melatonin rhythm, and this effect varied among species. Controlling for phylogenetic differences, the results indicate that the pineal glands of shade-dwelling species are more sensitive to photic resetting than species living in more brightly illuminated habitats. The differences were not due to variation in free-running period, but may be due to variation in oscillator phase and/or robustness. Surprisingly, thermal resetting was not statistically significant. Overall, the results suggest that the Anolis circadian system is adapted to photic habitat.
