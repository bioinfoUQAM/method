"We describe range-wide phylogeographic variation in gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis), a boreal Nearctic corvid that occurs today primarily in recently glaciated regions. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (1041 base pairs ND2 gene; N=205, 50 localities) revealed four reciprocally monophyletic groups. One widespread clade occurs across the North American boreal zone, from Newfoundland to Alaska and southwest into Utah. Three other clades occur at lower latitudes in the montane West in Colorado, the northern Rocky Mountains, and the Pacific Northwest respectively. The geographic distribution of clades in gray jays corresponds with a general pattern that is emerging for boreal taxa, having one widespread northern clade and one or more geographically restricted southwestern clades. Population genetic analyses indicate that the larger boreal clade is genetically structured and harbors significantly more genetic diversity than those clades occurring at lower latitudes. Species distribution modeling (SDM) revealed multiple putative Pleistocene refugia including several occurring at higher latitudes. We suggest that multiple post-glacial colonization routes, some of which originate from these northern refugia, are responsible for the relatively high genetic diversity at high latitudes. Conversely, lower latitude clades show little variation, probably as a result of historical restriction to smaller geographical areas with smaller long-term population sizes. This 'upside-down' pattern of genetic diversity contrasts with the conventional view that populations of north-temperate species occupying previously glaciated habitats should possess lower levels of diversity than their southern counterparts."
