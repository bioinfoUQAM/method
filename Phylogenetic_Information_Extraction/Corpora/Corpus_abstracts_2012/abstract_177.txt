An actinomycete strain 234402(T) was isolated from a mangrove soil sample collected in Wenchang, China. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain 234402(T) indicated that the highest similarity was to Verrucosispora sediminis MS426(T) (99.25%). The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The major menaquinones were MK-9(H(4)) and MK-9(H(6)), with MK-9(H(8)) as minor components. The characteristic whole-cell sugars were xylose, mannose and glucose. The phospholipid profile was found to comprise phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and an unknown phospholipid. The DNA G+C content was 69.2'mol%. The results of physiological and biochemical tests and low DNA-DNA relatedness demonstrated strain 234402(T) could be readily distinguished from the closely related Verrucosispora species. On the basis of these phenotypic and genotypic data, strain 234402(T) represents a novel species of the genus Verrucosispora, for which the name Verrucosispora wenchangensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 234402(T) (=CCTCC AA 2011018(T)=DSM 45674(T)).
