Two bacterial strains, designated Kc1(T) and Kc5(T), were isolated from soil in Japan. These two strains were Gram-positive, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, motile rods. The phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that these strains belong to the genus Cellulomonas. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains Kc1(T) and Kc5(T) showed closest similarity to that of Cellulomonas terrae DB5(T) (98.1 % and 98.4 % similarity, respectively). The 16S rRNA gene similarity between these two novel strains was 97.8 %. The major menaquinone was MK-9 (H(4)), and the polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol mannosides in both strains. These two strains contained ornithine and glutamic acid in their peptidoglycan. The cell-wall sugars were rhamnose, galactose and mannose for strain Kc1(T), and rhamnose and glucose for strain Kc5(T). The DNA G + C contents of strains Kc1(T) and Kc5(T) were 73.6 and 75.8 mol%, respectively. From the chemotaxonomic and physiological data and the result of DNA-DNA hybridization, these two strains should be classified as two novel species of the genus Cellulomonas, for which the names Cellulomonas soli sp. nov. (type strain Kc1(T) = DSM 24484(T) = JCM 17535(T)) and Cellulomonas oligotrophica sp. nov. (type strain Kc5(T) = DSM 24482(T) = JCM 17534(T)) are proposed.
