Two strains (JA266T and JA333) of Gram-negative, rod shaped, phototrophic, purple nonsulfur bacteria were isolated from a freshwater fish pond and an industrial effluent. Both phototrophic and chemotrophic growth is possible by both strains. Bacteriochlorophyll a and carotenoids of the spirilloxanthin series were present as photosynthetic pigments. Major fatty acid for both strains is C18:1_7c (>65 %) with minor amounts of 11methyl C18:1_7c, C16:0, C16:1_7c and C18:0 also present. Lamellar type of intracellular photosynthetic membranes is present in both the strains. Ubiquinone-10 and rhodoquinone-10 are present as primary quinone components. Diphosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl ethanolamine and phosphatidyl choline are the major polar lipids, while minor amounts of amino lipids (AL1, 2) and an unidentified lipid (L1) are common to both the strains. The genomic G+C content of the strains JA266T and JA333 was 71.3 and 69.9 mol% respectively. Phylogenetic analysis on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that both strains clustered with species of the genus Rhodoplanes in the class Alphaproteobacteria. Strains JA266T and JA333 have sequence similarity of 98.7 % and 98.9 % with Rhodoplanes serenus TUT3530T, 96.4 % and 96.5 % with Rhodoplanes elegans AS130T respectively and less than 96 % with other members of the genus Rhodoplanes. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between the two strains is 99.3 % and exhibited high (84.7 %) relatedness based on DNA-DNA hybridization. Further, both strains have less than 65 % relatedness with the type strain Rhodoplanes serenus TUT3530T. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic data, it is proposed that strains JA266T be classified as a novel species of the genus Rhodoplanes with the species name Rhodoplanes piscinae sp. nov. The type strains of the proposed new species is JA266T (=JCM 14934T=KCTC 5627T), while strain JA333 (=NBRC 107574 =KCTC 5962) be an additional strain.
