Floral nectar of some animal-pollinated plants usually harbours highly-adapted yeast communities which can profoundly alter nectar characteristics and, therefore, potentially have significant impacts on plant reproduction through their effects on insect foraging behaviour. Bacteria have also been occasionally observed in floral nectar, but their prevalence, phylogenetic diversity and ecological role within plant-pollinator-yeast systems remains unclear. In this article we present the first ever reported survey of bacteria in floral nectar from a natural plant community. Culturable bacteria occurring in a total of 71 nectar samples collected from 27 South African plant species were isolated and identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Rarefaction-based analyses were used to assess Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) richness at the plant community using nectar drops as sampling units. Our results showed that bacteria are common inhabitants of floral nectar of South African plants (53.5% of samples yielded growth), and their communities are characterised by low species richness (18 OTUs at the 3% DNA dissimilarity cut-off) and moderate phylogenetic diversity, with most isolates belonging to the Gamma subdivision of the phylum Proteobacteria. Furthermore, isolates showed osmotolerance, catalase activity and ability to grow in microaerobiosis, three traits that might help bacteria to overcome important factors limiting their survival and/or growth in nectar.
