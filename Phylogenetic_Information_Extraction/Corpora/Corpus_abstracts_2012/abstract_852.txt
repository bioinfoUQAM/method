A Gram-staining-negative, non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic, non-flagellated, non-gliding, rod-shaped bacterial strain, BR-18T, was isolated from marine sand on the western coast of South Korea, and subjected to a polyphasic study. Strain BR-18T grew optimally at 25 'C, at pH 6.5-7.0 and in the absence of NaCl. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain BR-18T fell within the clade comprising Mucilaginibacter species, joining the type strains of Mucilaginibacter rigui and 'Mucilaginibacter lutimaris', with which it exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 95.9 and 96.6 %, respectively. Sequence similarity to the type strains of the other Mucilaginibacter species was 93.4-95.5 % and less than 91.6 % to the other species used in the phylogenetic analysis. Strain BR-18T contained MK-7 as the predominant menaquinone, summed feature 3 (C16:1 _7c and/or iso-C15:0 2-OH) and iso-C15:0 as the major fatty acids and sphingolipids. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified aminophospholipid. The DNA G+C content was 42.4 mol%. The phylogenetic distinctiveness and differential phenotypic properties revealed that strain BR-18T is separate from other Mucilaginibacter species. On the basis of the data presented, strain BR-18T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Mucilaginibacter, for which the name Mucilaginibacter litoreus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is BR-18T (= KCTC 23697T = CCUG 61484T).
