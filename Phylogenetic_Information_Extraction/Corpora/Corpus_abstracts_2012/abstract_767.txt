Herein we report the biological and molecular characterization of a virulent genotype VII Newcastle disease virus (NDV) circulating in Venezuela and the assessment of the vaccination efficacy under field conditions when compared to controlled rearing conditions. Biological pathotyping showed a mean embryo dead time of 50 hours and an intracerebral pathogenicity index of 1.86. Sequence based phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the virus belongs to genotype VII in the class II (a genotype often found in Asia and Africa), representing the first report of the presence of this genotype in the American continent. A vaccine-challenge trial in commercial broilers reared on the field or in a experimental setting included dual (live/killed) 1-day-old priming plus two live NDV and Infectious bursal disease (IBDV) field vaccinations at seven and 17 days, followed by a very stringent genotype VII NDV challenge at day 28. Serology for NDV and IBDV, bursal integrity and protection against NDV lethal challenge were assessed. At 28 days, field vaccinates showed significantly lower NDV (1.356 vs. 2.384) and higher IBD (7295 vs 1489) ELISA antibody titres than the experimentally reared birds. Lower bursal size and bursa-body weight ratio (P<0.05) and higher bursa lesions score were also detected in the field set. Only 57.1% of field vaccinates survived the lethal challenge, differing (P<0.05) from 90.5% survival in the experimental farm. Overall, results confirmed the presence of the genotype VII viruses in America and suggest that field associated factors such as immunosuppression compromise the efficacy of the vaccination protocols implemented.
