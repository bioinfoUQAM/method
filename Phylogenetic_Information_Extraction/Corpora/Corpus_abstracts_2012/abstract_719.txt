A Gram-reaction-negative, non-motile bacterial strain forming straight rods and straw yellow-pigmented colonies, was subjected to a detailed polyphasic taxonomy study. The strain, designated FCS-5T, matched with most of the phenotypic properties of the genus Flavobacterium. The major fatty acids were iso-C15:0, iso-C17:03OH, C17:1_9c and summed feature 3 (comprising iso-C15:0 2OH and/or C16:1_7c) and only isoprenoid quinone was MK-6. The only polyamine was homospermidine and the major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 32.4 mol%. According to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain FCS-5T belonged to the genus Flavobacterium, sharing 99.3% sequence similarity with Flavobacterium beibuense F44-8T and 90.9%-94.6% sequence similarity with all other species in the genus Flavobacterium. The results of physiological and biochemical tests allowed the discrimination of strain FCS-5T from its phylogenetic relatives indicating that it should be recognized as a novel species of the genus Flavobacterium, for which the name Flavobacterium rakeshii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is FCS-5T (=MTCC 10967T = JCM 17928T). An emended description of Flavobacterium beibuense is also proposed.
