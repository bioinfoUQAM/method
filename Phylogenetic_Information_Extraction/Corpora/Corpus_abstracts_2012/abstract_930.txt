Specimens were collected from February through April of 2010 from patients presenting with ILI who were previously confirmed as positive for hMPV by real-time RT-PCR. A 700 base pair region of the hMPV fusion (F) gene was amplified, sequenced and resulting sequences aligned. A phylogenic tree was constructed based on prototype strains, and the partial F gene sequences obtained in this study.
