Two Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterial strains, H101(T) and H207, were isolated from deep sea water collected from South-West Indian Ocean. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the two strains were closely related to one another (100% similarity), and had the closest relationship with Microbacterium hominis NBRC 15708(T) and Microbacterium insulae KCTC 19247(T) (98.2-98.3% similarities). DNA-DNA hybridization value between strains H101(T) and H207 was 87.2O3.7%, and the values between the two strains and the closely related type strains were well below 70%. The two strains also shared a number of physiological and biochemical characteristics that were distinct from the closely related species, and grew at 2-37'C, pH 5-11 and 0-8% (w/v) NaCl. Both strains contained MK-12, MK-13 and MK-11 as the detected menaquinones. The peptidoglycan was of type B1_ with an interpeptide bridge D-Glu(Hyg)_Gly(2)_l-Lys. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0), anteiso-C(17:0), and iso-C(16:0). Based on the genetic and phenotypic properties, it is proposed that strains H101(T) and H207 be classified as representatives of a novel species of the genus Microbacterium, with the name Microbacterium marinum sp. nov. The type strain is H101(T) (=CGMCC 4.6941(T)=DSM 24947(T)).
