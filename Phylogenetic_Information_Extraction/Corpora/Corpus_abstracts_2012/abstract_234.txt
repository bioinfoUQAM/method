"The effect of a proton-pump inhibitor on gastrointestinal microbiota was evaluated. Eight healthy 9-month-old dogs (4 males and 4 females) received omeprazole (1.1 mg/kg) orally twice a day for 15 days. Fecal samples and endoscopic biopsies from the stomach and duodenum were obtained on days 30 and 15 before omeprazole administration, on day 15 (last day of administration), and 15 days after administration. The microbiota was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene 454-pyrosequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and qPCR. In the stomach, pyrosequencing revealed a decrease in Helicobacter spp. during omeprazole (median 92% of sequences during administration compared to >98% before and after administration; P=0.0336), which was accompanied by higher proportions of Firmicutes and Fusobacteria. FISH confirmed this decrease in gastric Helicobacter (P<0.0001) and showed an increase in total bacteria in the duodenum (P=0.0033) during omeprazole. However, Unifrac analysis showed that omeprazole administration did not significantly alter the overall phylogenetic composition of the gastric and duodenal microbiota. In feces, qPCR showed an increase in Lactobacillus spp. during omeprazole (P<0.0001), which was accompanied by a lower abundance of Faecalibacterium spp. and Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas in the male dogs. This study suggests that omeprazole administration leads to quantitative changes in gastrointestinal microbiota of healthy dogs. Copyright PI 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.
