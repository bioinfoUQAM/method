B3 domain-containing proteins constitute a large transcription factor superfamily. The plant-specific B3 superfamily consists of four family members, i.e., LAV (LEC2 [LEAFY COTYLEDON 2]/ABI3 [ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3]'-'VAL [VP1/ABI3-LIKE]), RAV (RELATED to ABI3/VP1), ARF (AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR) and REM (REPRODUCTIVE MERISTEM) families. The B3 superfamily plays a central role in plant life, from embryogenesis to seed maturation and dormancy. In previous research, we have characterized ARF family, member of the B3 superfamily in silico (Wang et al., Mol Biol Rep, 2011, doi: 10.1007/s11033-011-0991-z ). In this study, we systematically analyzed the diversity, phylogeny and evolution of B3 domain-containing proteins based on genomic resources of 11 sequenced species. A total of 865 B3 domain-containing genes were identified from 11 sequenced species through an iterative strategy. The number of B3 domain-containing genes varies not only between species but between gene families. B3 domain-containing genes are unevenly distributed in chromosomes and tend to cluster in the genome. Numerous combinations of B3 domains and their partner domains contribute to the sequences and structural diversification of the B3 superfamiy. Phylogenetic results showed that moss VAL proteins are related to LEC2/ABI3 instead of VAL proteins from higher plants. Lineage-specific expansion of ARF and REM proteins was observed. The REM family is the most diversified member among the B3 superfamily and experiences a rapid divergence during selective sweep. Based on structural and phylogenetic analysis results, two possible evolutional modes of the B3 superfamily were presented. Results presented here provide a resource for further characterization of the B3 superfamily.
