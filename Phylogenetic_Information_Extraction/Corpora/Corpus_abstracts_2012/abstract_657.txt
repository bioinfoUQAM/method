This study characterized the phylogenetic diversity of soil bacteria producing nematode-attracting volatiles and their nematode-attracting compounds. Results would enhance our understanding on the interaction between nematodes and soil microorganisms and potentially enhance the biocontrol efficiency when combined the attractants with nemacides.
