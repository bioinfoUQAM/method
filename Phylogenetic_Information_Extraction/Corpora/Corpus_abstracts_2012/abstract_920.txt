The Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana 1852) is widely distributed throughout the Southern Ocean, where it provides a key link between primary producers and upper trophic levels and supports a major commercial fishery. Despite its ecological and commercial importance, genetic population structure of the Antarctic krill remains poorly described. In an attempt to illuminate genetic markers for future population and phylogenetic analysis, five E. superba mitogenomes, from samples collected west of the Antarctic Peninsula, were sequenced using new 454 next-generation sequencing techniques. The sequences, of lengths between 13,310 and 13,326 base pairs, were then analyzed in the context of two previously-published near-complete sequences. Sequences revealed relatively well-conserved partial mitochondrial genomes which included complete sequences for 11 of 13 protein-coding genes, 16 of 23 tRNAs, and the large ribosomal subunit. Partial sequences were also recovered for cox1 and the small ribosomal subunit. Sequence analysis suggested that the cox2, nad5, and nad6 genes would be the best candidates for future population genetics analyses, due to their high number of variable sites. Future work to reveal the noncoding control region remains.
