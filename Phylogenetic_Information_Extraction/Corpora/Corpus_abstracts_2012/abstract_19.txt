Campylobacter have emerged as the most common bacterial food-borne illness in the developed world. The ability to reduce Campylobacter infections in humans is linked to the full comprehension of the principal key aspects of its infection cycle. A microbial diagnostic microarray detecting Campylobacter housekeeping, structural, and virulence associated genes was designed and validated using genomic DNA from reference and field strains of Campylobacter jejuni and coli isolated from human, chicken, and raw milk. This microarray was confirmed to be a powerful diagnostic tool for monitoring emerging Campylobacter pathotypes as well as for epidemiological, environmental, and phylogenetic studies including the evaluation of genome plasticity.
