One of the long-standing arguments about the evolution of bipedality centers on the locomotor pattern used by the last common ancestor (LCA) of apes and humans. In particular, knuckle-walking has been suggested as this locomotor pattern on the basis of shared morphology in the upper limb between African apes and humans and phylogenetic parsimony. Using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics, this study tests whether the distal radius of extant hominoids is sufficient for determining locomotor pattern and the affiliations of Plio-Pleistocene hominins to the extant taxa. Results indicate that while the entire radius differentiates the extant taxa very well by locomotor pattern, the distal radius fails to clearly differentiate the extant taxa. The sigmoid notch of the distal radius is the anatomical feature that differs most among the extant taxa, and its variability broadly correlates with necessary mobility at the wrist joint. Principal components and discriminant function analyses indicate that early hominins are affiliated with a variety of extant taxa with different locomotor patterns. Overall, the bony anatomy of the distal radius of early hominins points towards something adapted for a wide variety of locomotor postures. Anat Rec, 2012. PI 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
