To understand the distribution and diversity of archaea in Chinese soils, the archaeal communities in a series of topsoils and soil profiles were investigated using quantitative PCR, T-RFLP combining sequencing methods. Archaeal 16S rRNA gene copy numbers, ranging from 4.96'u'10(6) to 1.30'u'10(8) 'copies'g(-1) dry soil, were positively correlated with soil pH, organic carbon and total nitrogen in the topsoils. In the soil profiles, archaeal abundance was positively correlated with soil pH but negatively with depth profile. The relative abundance of archaea in the prokaryotes (sum of bacteria and archaea) ranged from 0.20% to 9.26% and tended to increase along the depth profile. T-RFLP and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the structure of archaeal communities in cinnamon soils, brown soils, and fluvo-aquic soils was similar and dominated by Crenarchaeota group 1.1b and 1.1a. These were different from those in red soils, which were dominated by Crenarchaeota group 1.3 and 1.1c. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the archaeal community was primarily influenced by soil pH.
