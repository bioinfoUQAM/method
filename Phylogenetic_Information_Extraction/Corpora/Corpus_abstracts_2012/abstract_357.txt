A Gram-staining negative, strictly aerobic bacterium, designated 101-1T, was isolated from a sea tidal flat of Taean in Korea. The strain formed small light-yellow, smooth, and circular colonies on marine agar. Cells were weakly halophilic, motile rods showing catalase- and oxidase-positive reactions. Growth of strain 101-1T was observed at 15-40 'C (optimum: 30 'C), pH 5.0-8.0 (optimum: pH 6.5-7.0) and 1.0-9.0 % (w/v) of NaCl (optimum: 2.0-3.5 %). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 53.3 mol%. Strain 101-1T contained ubiquinone-10 (Q-10) as the respiratory quinone and iso-C17:1 _9c, iso-C15:0 and iso-C17:0 as major fatty acids. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain 101-1T formed a tight phylogenetic lineage with the members of the genus Kordiimonas and was most closely related to Kordiimonas gwangyangensis GW14-5T and Kordiimonas lacus S3-22T with 97.3 % and 96.3 % of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, respectively. The DNA-DNA relatedness between strain 101-1T and K. gwangyangensis GW14-5T K. lacus S3-22T was 24.8O4.4 % and 32.2O3.6 %, respectively. Based on the phenotypic and genotypic studies, strain 101-1T represents a novel species of the genus Kordiimonas, for which the name Kordiimonas aestuarii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 101-1T (=KACC 16184T = JCM 17742T).
