Two phenolic compounds, JBIR-94 (1) and JBIR-125 (2), were isolated from the fermentation broth of strain R56-07, which was identified by phylogenetic methods as a novel species of Streptomyces. The structures of 1 and 2 were assigned on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and MS analyses. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity with an IC(50) value of 11.4 and 35.1 _M, respectively. These compounds are the first examples of hydroxycinnamic acid amides containing putrescine or spermidine produced by actinomycetes.
