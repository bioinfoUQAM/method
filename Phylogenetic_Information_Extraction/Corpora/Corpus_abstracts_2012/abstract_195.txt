A novel obligately anaerobic, mesophilic, organotrophic bacterium, strain P3M-1T, was isolated from a microbial mat formed in wooden bath filled with hot water emerging from a 2775-m deep well in Tomsk region (Western Siberia, Russia). Cells of strain P3M-1T were rod-shaped, 0.3-0.7 Em in width, gathered in multicellullar filaments that reached up to 400 Em in length. Strain P3M-1T grew optimally at 42-45 'C, pH 7.5-8.0 and NaCl concentration of 1 g l-1. At the optimum conditions the doubling time was 6 hours. The isolate was able to ferment a variety of proteinaceous substrates and sugars, including microcrystalline cellulose. Acetate, ethanol and H2 were the main products of glucose fermentation. G+C content of DNA was 55 mol%. 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analysis showed that strain P3M-1T was a member of class Anaerolinea with 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with the closest relative - Levilinea saccharolytica - being 92.8 %. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and physiological properties a new genus and species Ornatilinea apprima gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain P3M-1T = DSM 23815T = VKM B-2669T) were proposed for the new isolate.
