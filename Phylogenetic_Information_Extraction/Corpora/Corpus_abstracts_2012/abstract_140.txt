Genetic sequences of 72 samples from HIV infected marriage-based immigrant women were obtained. The genetic subtypes comprised 21 CRF01_AE (29.2%), 12 CRF07_BC (16.7%), 31 CRF08_BC (43.1%), 6 B (8.3%), 2 C (2.8%). HIV strains from 45 cases (62.5%) were similar to the prevalent HIV strains in the province where former census of marriage-based immigrant women were registered. In total, there were 26 (70.3%) cases from Yunnan province. 84.7% of the infected women had heterosexual behaviors before settling down in Zhejiang province. Genetic sequences of 17 pairs showed the same subtype between the couples and data from phylogenetic tree analysis supported the assumption of transmission linkage in the family.
