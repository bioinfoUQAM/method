During a recent phylogenetic study, group I introns were noted that interrupt the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rDNA) gene in species of Ceratocystiopsis. Group I introns were found to be inserted at the following rDNA positions: S943, S989, and S1199. The introns have been characterized and phylogenetic analysis of the host gene and the corresponding intron data suggest that for S943 vertical transfer and frequent loss appear to be the most parsimonious explanation for the distribution of nuclear SSU rDNA introns among species of Ceratocystiopsis. The SSU rDNA data do suggest that a recent proposal of segregating the genus Ophiostoma sensu lato into Ophiostoma sensu stricto, Grosmannia, and Ceratocystiopsis has some merit but may need further amendments, as the SSU rDNA suggests that Ophiostoma s. str. may now represent a paraphyletic grouping.
