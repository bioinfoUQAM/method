Since the first outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian inafluenza (HPAI) in Bangladesh in February 2007, a total of 519 disease events have been reported till 22 October 2011. Partial HA gene sequences of 11 selected H5N1 HPAI isolates of 2007 to 2011 were determined and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The study revealed a recent introduction of clade 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 viruses into Bangladesh in 2011 in addition to clade 2.2 viruses that had been in circulation since 2007. Clade 2.3.2 virus isolates from Bangladesh are phylogenetically related to the newly designated clade 2.3.2.1 viruses, reported recently from Asia and Eastern Europe.
