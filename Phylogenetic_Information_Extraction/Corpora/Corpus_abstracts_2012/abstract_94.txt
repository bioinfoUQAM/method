"Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK) is a common ocular disease of cattle, which is generally thought to be caused by Moraxella bovis. However, a recently characterized Moraxella, M. bovoculi, has been isolated from animals with IBK. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize strains of Moraxella spp. obtained from IBK cases in different geographic locations within Uruguay. Ribosomal gene sequencing indicated that there were two groups of isolates that showed homology with either M. bovis or M. bovoculi. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of two species as the isolates grouped in different branches of the dendrogram. Conventional biochemical characterization did not distinguish between the species; only 9/25 isolates which had genetic homology with M. bovoculi showed any differences in biochemistry."
