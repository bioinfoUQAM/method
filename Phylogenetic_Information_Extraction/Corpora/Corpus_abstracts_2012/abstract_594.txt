The bacterial strain LH2-2T was isolated from freshwater of Longhu Lake, a slightly alkaline lake (pH 8.8), in Northeast of China. Cells of strain LH2-2T were Gram-staining negative, non-spore-forming rods measuring 0.3-0.5 _m in width and 2.0-4.0 _m in length. Cells were motile by means of a single polar flagellum. Strictly aerobic and heterotrophic. Oxidase- and catalase-positive. Growth occurs at 0-36 'C (optimum, 26-34'C), pH 6.5-11 (optimum, pH 8.0-8.6) and in the presence of 0-2 % NaCl (w/v, optimum, 1%). Strain LH2-2T contained Q-8 as the major respiratory quinine. The major fatty acids were summed feature 3 (C16:1_7c and/or iso-C15:0 2-OH, 21.9 %), C17:1_8c (18.9%), C18:1_7c (16.4%) and C16:0 (12.7%) when it was grown on marine agar 2216. DNA G+C content was 47 mol% (Tm). The 16S rRNA gene and a conserved portion of gyrase B gene (gyrB) were sequenced and used for phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene and gyrB sequences showed that strain LH2-2T was associated with the genus Rheinheimera and closely related to the type strains of Rheinheimera species, and showed highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to R. pacifica KMM 1406T (97.4 %), and then to R. aquimaris SW-353T (97.1 %) and R. chironomi K19414T (96.5 %). The DNA-DNA relatedness of strain LH2-2T to R. pacifica KMM 1406T, R. aquimaris SW-353T and R. chironomi K19414T was 39, 31 and 23 %, respectively. Based on these results, it is concluded that strain LH2-2T represents a novel species of the genus Rheinheimera, for which the name Rheinheimera longhuensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is LH2-2T (=CGMCC 1.7003T= NBRC 105632T).
