ABSTRACT: The surge of advances in understanding ontological, phylogenetic, pathological, paleoanthropological and genetic insights in development and evolution over the past century has resulted in a profound revolution of our cognizance of biological sciences. The past decade of the human genome project has provided opportunities for diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic interventions and prevention of dysgenesis, dysmorphology, and disease. The new technologies of imaging and experimental inquiries into developmental phenomena provide insights into evolutionary advances that have taken place to result in the present human structure.
