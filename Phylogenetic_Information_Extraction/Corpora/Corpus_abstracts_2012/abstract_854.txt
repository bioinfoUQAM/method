"Gram-staining-negative, motile bacteria, designated as MJ01T and MJ14 were isolated from a sludge sample of the Daejeon sewage disposal plant in Korea and were characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strains MJ01T and MJ14 belonged to the genus Rhodanobacter in the family Xanthomonadaceae of the Gammaproteobacteria. According to 16S rRNA gene sequences strains MJ01T and MJ14 were indistinguishable and showed 98.8% - 96.4% similarity levels with other Rhodanobacter species. Strain MJ01T exhibited relatively high levels of DNA hybridization values (89.3 %) with MJ14 and low level of DNA hybridization values (< 60 %) with other Rhodanobacter species. The DNA G+C content of the strains MJ01T and MJ14 were 65.3 and 64.8 mol %, respectively. Both strains contained ubiquinone Q-8 as major respiratory quinone. The major fatty acids were C15:0 iso, C16:0 and C17:0 iso. The polar lipids profile of strains MJ01T and MJ14 include predominantly diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG) followed by phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and minor amounts of unknown amino-lipids and phospholipids. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic properties, as well as phylogenetic distinctiveness, strains MJ01T and MJ14 should be classified in a novel species, for which the name Rhodanobacter caeni sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MJ01T (= KCTC 22449T = JCM 16242T); strain MJ14 (= KCTC 22460 = JCM 16243)."
