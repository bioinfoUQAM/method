Two new obligately anaerobic Gram-positive, saccharolytic and non-proteolytic spore-forming bacilli (strain CD3:22 and N1) are described. Strain CD3:22 was isolated from a biopsy of the small intestine of a child with celiac disease and strain N1 from the saliva of a healthy young man. The cells of both strains were observed to be filamentous with lengths of approximately 5 to >20 Em, some of them curving and with swellings. The novel organisms produced H2S, NH3, butyric acid and acetic acid as major metabolic end products. Phylogenetic analyses, based on comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing, revealed close relationships (98 % sequence similarity) between the two isolates, as well as the type strain of Eubacterium saburreum CCUG 28089T and four other Lachnospiraceae bacterium/E. saburreum-like organisms. This group of bacteria were clearly different from any of the 19 known genera in the family Lachnospiraceae. While Eubacterium spp. are reported to be non-spore-forming, reanalysis of E. saburreum CCUG 28089T confirmed that the bacterium, indeed, is able to form spores. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, phenotypic and biochemical properties, CD3:22 (CCUG 58757T) and N1 (CCUG 60305T) represent new species of a new and distinct genus, named Lachnoanaerobaculum, in the family Lachnospiraceae [within the order Clostridiales, class Clostridia, phylum Firmicutes]. Strain CD3:22 is the type strain of the type species, Lachnoanaerobaculum umeaense gen. nov., sp. nov., of the proposed new genus. Strain N1 is the type strain of the species, Lachnoanaerobaculum orale gen. nov., sp. nov. Moreover, E. saburreum CCUG 28089T is reclassified as Lachnoanaerobaculum saburreum comb. nov.
