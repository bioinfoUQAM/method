The complete nucleotide sequence of both genomic (+)ss RNAs of a rhubarb isolate of Cherry leaf roll virus (CLRV) was determined. The larger RNA1 is 7918 nucleotides and the shorter RNA2 6360 nucleotides in size, each genome component comprising a single open reading frame (ORF). The RNA1-encoded polyprotein (P1) is 2112 amino acids long (235.6kDa) containing domains characteristic for a proteinase-cofactor (PCo), nucleotide-binding helicase (Hel), genome-linked protein (VPg), proteinase (Pro), and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol). The RNA2-encoded polyprotein (P2) has a molecular mass of 174.9kDa (1589aa) encoding the putative movement protein (MP) and the coat protein (CP) of CLRV. The genome region upstream of the MP has a coding capacity of 77kDa, however processing of P2 by the putative virus-encoded proteinase and protein-function encoded by this region is unknown. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that the 5'-termini including the N-terminal region (208aa) of P1 and P2 of the rhubarb isolate of CLRV are nearly identical among the two genome segments. The taxonomic position of CLRV as member of the genus Nepovirus was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses employing the amino acid sequences of the conserved Pro-Pol region of RNA1, the complete P2, and the CP. However, clustering of Nepovirus-species according to allocated subgroups was inconsistent and depended on the compared genome fragment.
