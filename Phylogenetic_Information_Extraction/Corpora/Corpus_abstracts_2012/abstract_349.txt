A bacterial strain Dd16T was isolated from a hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) dumpsite at Lucknow, India. Dd16T is gram negative, non-motile, rod shaped and yellow pigmented. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that the strain belongs to the genus Sphingomonas in the family Sphingomonadaceae, as it showed highest sequence similarity to Sphingomonas asaccharolytica IFO 15499T (95.36 %), Sphingosinicella vermicomposti YC7378T (95.30), Sphingomonas humi PB323T (95.20 %), Sphingomonas sanxanigenens NX02T (95.14 %) and Sphingomonas desiccabilis CP1DT (95.00 %). The major fatty acids are Summed feature 3 (16:1_7c/16:1_6C, 57.02%) , C14:02OH (33.20%), Summed feature 8( C18:1_7C, 28.30%) and C16:0 (10.89%). The polar lipid profile of strain Dd16T also corresponded to those reported for other Sphingomonas species (phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, sphingoglycolipids), thus again supporting its identification as a member of the genus Sphingomonas. The predominant respiratory quinone was ubiquinone Q10. Sym-homospermidine was the major polyamine observed in the cell. The total DNA G+C % of Dd16T was 65.8 mol%. The results obtained on the basis of phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis and after biochemical and physiological tests clearly distinguished Dd16T from closely related members of genus Sphingomonas. Thus, the strain Dd16T is described as a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas for which the name Sphingomonas indica Dd16T is proposed. The type strain is Dd16T (=DSM 25434T = CCM 7882T).
