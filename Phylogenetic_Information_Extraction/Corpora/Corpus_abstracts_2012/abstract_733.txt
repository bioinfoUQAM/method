Characterization, direct sequencing of the PCR amplicon and phylogenetic relationship was done to discover a novel Vip protein genes of the Bt isolates, to improve the prospects for insect control, more Vip proteins should be sought out and researched to predict their insecticidal activity. Characterization was based on direct sequencing of PCR amplicon using primers specific to vip3A gene was presented here. 12 out of 18 isolates screened were positive for vip gene-specific primers. Homology search for the partial sequences using BLAST showed that 11 isolates had high similarity to vip3Aa gene and only one fragment with vip3Ae gene (25-100% at nucleotide and amino acid level). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the gene sequences were responsible for geographic separation for divergence within vip genes, consistent with the evaluation of distinct bacterial population. Despite the geographical distances, strains harbouring vip genes have originated from common ancestors may significantly contribute to control resistant insect pests. Some strains have evolved to be quite distinct and others remain as members of closely related groups. The reported method is a powerful tool to find novel Vip3A proteins from large-scale Bt strains which is effective in terms of time and cost. Further the Vip proteins produced by different strains of B. thuringiensis are unique in terms of the sequence divergence and hence may also differ in their insecticidal activities.
