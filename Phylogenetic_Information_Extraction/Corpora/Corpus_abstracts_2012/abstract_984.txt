This study demonstrates that bla(CTX-M-15)-carrying plasmids from cattle-derived non-ST131 E. coli isolates were highly similar to those found in ST131 E. coli isolates commonly reported in humans. It also exemplifies the key role of plasmids versus clonal dissemination in the spread of the bla(CTX-M-15) gene among cattle, and possibly between E. coli isolates detected in humans and cattle.
