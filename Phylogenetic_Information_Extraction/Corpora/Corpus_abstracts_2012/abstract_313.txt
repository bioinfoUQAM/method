"The highly pathogenic Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) has caused severe damages to sericulture in many countries, and the relationship between the pathogenicity of various BmNPV strains and their geographical evolution has been the topic of our interest. In this study, we isolated a new BmNPV strain from Thailand (BmNPV-Thai), based on the sequences of its conservative genes p10, p35, polh, egt and vp39. The BmNPV-Thai appears to have baculovirus repeated ORF (bro) genes different from four other well-known BmNPV strains of China (GD, CQ1), Japan (T3), and France (SC7); It only has bro-a, bro-c, and bro-d, but not bro-b and bro-e genes. These bro genes are localized only in the two subgroups highly homologous to their counterparts and their encoded BRO proteins differ mainly at their N-terminal amino acid residues. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the evolution of the bro genes of the five BmNPV strains is not obviously associated with their geographic locations."
