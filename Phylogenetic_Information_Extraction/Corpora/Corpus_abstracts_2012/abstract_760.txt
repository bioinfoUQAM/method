For phylogenetic comparison of hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates, often a region of the HBV surface gene is analysed. Because the surface gene completely overlaps the polymerase gene, its evolution is constrained, and it may not be the best choice for genetic comparison of HBV isolates. Analysing serial sample pairs of 33 chronically HBV-infected, untreated patients, with a cumulative follow-up of 184 years, the synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates of a part of the overlapping HBV surface and polymerase genes were compared to those of a nonoverlapping part of the HBV core gene. The substitution rate of the HBV core gene was higher (8.15 u 10(-4) vs 4.57 u 10(-4) substitutions/site/year) than that of the surface gene. The difference was mainly due to a significantly lower synonymous substitution rate in the surface gene, with dN/dS ratios of 0.412 in the core gene and 0.986 in the surface gene. Contrary to the core gene, the number of substitutions in the surface gene was higher in low viraemic hosts, who control HBV infection by suppressing replication. The number of substitutions in the core gene correlated more strongly with the duration of follow-up. The overlapping HBV surface and polymerase genes experience strong negative selection, which limits the number of substitutions. Because the HBV core gene reflects the duration of infection more accurately, it is more suitable for the analysis of short-term viral evolution and of hepatitis B transmission chains.
