The 16S rRNA and gyrB genes of 22 Streptomyces species belonging to the Streptomyce griseus cluster were sequenced, and their taxonomic positions were re-evaluated. For correct analysis, all of the publicly available sequences of the species were collected and compared with those obtained in this study. The species for which no consensus sequence could be identified were excluded from the phylogenetic analysis. The levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity within the cluster ranged from 98.6% to 100% with a mean value of 99.6O0.3%, and those of gyrB ranged from 93.6% to 99.9% with a mean value of 96.3O1.5%. The observed average nucleotide substitution rate of gyrB was ten times higher than that of 16S rRNA gene, showing a far higher degree of variation. The strains sharing 99.3% (corresponding to the evolutionary distance of 0.0073) and higher similarity of gyrB sequence always formed monophyletic clades in both trees. Through the combined analysis of both genes, cases of synonymy could be clearly identified and according to the priority rule, revival of S. setonii and reclassification of S. fimicarius as a later synonym of S. setonii and S. albovinaceus as a later synonym of S. globisporus are proposed.
