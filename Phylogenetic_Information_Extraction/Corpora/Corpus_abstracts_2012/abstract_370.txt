"We have identified and characterized the full length cDNA sequence of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) from the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis. The nucleotide and putative amino acid sequences from this study shared a high level of sequence conservation with other tick MIFs. The bioinformatics analysis showed across species conservation of the MIF amino acid sequence in ticks, insects and nematodes. The multiple sequence alignment identified Pro 1, 3, 55; Thr 7, 112; Asn 8, 72; Ile 64, 96; Gly 65, 110, Ser 63 and Leu 87 amino acids to be highly conserved among the sequences selected for this study. Tick MIF does not have the oxidoreductase domain as found in MIFs from other animals suggesting that tick MIF is not capable of performing as an oxidoreductase. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that tick MIFs share a closer evolutionary proximity to parasitic nematode MIFs than to insect MIFs."
