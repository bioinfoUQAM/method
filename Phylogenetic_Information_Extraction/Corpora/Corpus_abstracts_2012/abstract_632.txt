Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are phase II enzymes that facilitate the detoxification of xenobiotics, and also play important roles in antioxidant defense. In this study, we reported the cloning and molecular characteristics of seven genes of the GST family (VpGSTS1, VpGSTS2, VpGSTS3, VpGSTO, VpGSTMi, VpGSTM and VpGSTR) from Venerupis philippinarum together with mRNA tissue distribution patterns and temporal expression profiles in response to cadmium, copper and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) exposures. The deduced amino acid sequences of VpGSTs showed high similarities to counterparts of other species that clustered into the same clades in the phylogenetic analysis. At basal levels of tissue expression, most VpGSTs were highly expressed in hepatopancreas compared with other tissues. All VpGSTs showed differential response profiles depending on the concentrations of various toxicants and exposure times. More notably, the expressions of VpGSTS2 and VpGSTS3 transcripts were significantly up-regulated in hepatopancreas from Cu and B[a]P-exposed animals, indicating that these two sigma VpGSTs were highly sensitive to Cu and B[a]P exposure. However, the expressions of VpGSTM and VpGSTR were significantly induced by Cu or B[a]P exposure, respectively. These findings suggested the role of VpGSTS2, VpGSTS3, VpGSTM and VpGSTR in defense against oxidative stress and highlighted their potential as biomarkers to Cu or B[a]P exposure.
