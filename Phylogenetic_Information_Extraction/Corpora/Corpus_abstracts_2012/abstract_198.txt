A novel actinomycete strain, PS7-2T, which produced spore chains borne on the tip of short sporophores was isolated from a temperate peat swamp forest soil in Psu-Sang National Park, Phayao province, Thailand. The isolate contained glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, 3-hydroxy-diaminopimelic acid and meso-diaminopimelic acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. The whole-cell sugars of strain PS7-2T were glucose, mannose, rhamnose and xylose. The characteristic phospholipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The predominant menaquinone was MK-10(H8) and MK-9(H8). The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C15:0, anteiso-C15:0 and anteiso-C17:0. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 72.3 mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain PS7-2T should be classified in the genus Asanoa and it shared a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Asanoa hainanensis (99.5%), Asanoa iriomotensis (99.0%), Asanoa ishikariensis (98.9%) and Asanoa ferruginea (98.5%). The DNA-DNA hybridization result and some physiological and biochemical properties indicated that strain PS7-2T could be readily distinguished from its closest phylogenetic relatives. On the basis of these phenotypic and genotypic data, this strain represents a novel species, for which the name Asanoa siamensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain PS7-2T (=BCC 41921T =NBRC 107932T).
