Genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates is a useful tool for epidemiological control of tuberculosis (TB) and phylogenetic exploration of the pathogen. There is a lack of information on the discriminatory power of standard 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU) - variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) in India, which has the highest tuberculosis (TB) burden worldwide. Therefore, we assessed its utility on 69 M.'tuberculosis (MTB) isolates from patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, in comparison to standard insertion sequence (IS) 6110-Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) fingerprinting and spoligotyping. IS6110-RFLP (HGDI, 0.9987) identified a single cluster of 3 (4.3%) single-copy IS6110 isolates. Spoligotyping showed 69.5% clustering (HGDI, 0.8857). In contrast, MIRU-VNTR analysis identified 69 (100%) unique strains (HGDI, 1.0000). Within the study limits, this observed high discriminatory power suggests that 24-locus MIRU-VNTR genotyping could potentially be used to study long-term transmission of MTB infection in Mumbai. Moreover, high congruence between the MIRU-VNTR-based and spoligotyping-based strain groupings suggests that CAS, EAI and Beijing are the predominant strain lineages in the Mumbai TB patient population. The Beijing lineage isolates were found to be more significantly associated with multi-drug resistance (p'<'0.01) than CAS and EAI lineages.
