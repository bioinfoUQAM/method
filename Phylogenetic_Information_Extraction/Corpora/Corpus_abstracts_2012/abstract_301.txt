Molecular epidemiological study of novel strain of Rubella virus isolated during the outbreak in Western Siberia in 2004 was described. Detailed phylogenetic analysis performed based upon entire SP-region, which encodes all three Rubella structural proteins (C, E2, and E1), was implemented. This analysis provides characterization of this strain and classifies it as 1H genotype, thereby correcting previous classification of this strain based upon shorter nucleotide sequence, only encoding E1 protein. Therefore, this study identified the genotype of the Rubella virus not previously detected in Western Siberia (and even entire Russian Federation), which highlights the importance of more extensive characterization of genetic variability of the Rubella virus, especially with regard to potential influence of vaccination on the Rubella virus mutagenesis.
