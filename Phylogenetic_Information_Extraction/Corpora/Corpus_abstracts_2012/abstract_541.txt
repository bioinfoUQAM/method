Although extensive studies on the oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) in aerobic carboxydotrophic bacteria have been carried out for over 30'years, utilization of CO as a source of carbon and energy by mycobacteria was recognized only recently. Studies on pathogenic and nonpathogenic mycobacteria have revealed that the basis for CO utilization in these bacteria is different in many aspects from that of other aerobic carboxydobacteria. We review the basis for CO utilization in mycobacterial carboxydobacteria, which is unique from physiological, biochemical, molecular, genetic and phylogenetic points of view.
