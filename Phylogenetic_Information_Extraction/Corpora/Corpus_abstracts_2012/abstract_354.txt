A mesophilic, strictly microaerophilic, chemosynthetic bacterium, designated strain P2DT, was isolated from the sediment of an active shallow water hydrothermal vent in Paleochori bay, Milos, Greece. The cells were Gram-negative rods approximately 0.8-1.3 Em in length and 0.4-0.5 Em in width. Strain P2DT grew between 20 and 50 'C (optimum 35 'C), 10 and 50 g l-1 NaCl (optimum 30 g l-1) and pH 4.5 and 8.0 (optimum pH 5.5). The generation time under optimal conditions was 1.1 h. Growth occurred under chemolithoautotrophic conditions with S2O32- and CO2 as the energy and carbon sources, respectively. Oxygen (5%) was used as sole terminal electron acceptor. No growth was observed in the presence of acetate, formate, lactate, tryptone, and peptone. Chemolithoheterotrophic growth occurred in the presence of D(+)-glucose and sucrose as alternative carbon sources. No organic compound was used as electron donor. The G + C content of the genomic DNA was 44.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the closest relatives to strain P2DT belonged to the genera Thiomicrospira and Thioalkalimicrobium, with a sequence identity of 92% and 91%, respectively. Phylogenetic, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics indicated that strain P2DT represents a novel genus within the Gammaproteobacteria (family Piscirickettsiaceae), for which the name Galenea microaerophila gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is P2DT (= DSM 24963T = JCM 17795T).
