"A non-motile, coccobacilli-shaped and pink pigmented bacterium, designated strain 03SU10-PT, was isolated from the wetland freshwater (Woopo wetland, Republic of Korea). Cells were Gram reaction-negative, catalase- positive and oxidase-negative. The major fatty acids (> 10% of total) were C18:1_7c (59.6 %) and summed feature 3 (iso-C15:0 2-OH and/or C16:1_7c) (13.7 %). The predominant respiratory lipoquinone was Q-10. The DNA G+C content was 68 mol%. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanoldiamine, phosphatidylcholine and unknown aminolipid. Spermidine, putrescine and 1,3-diaminopropane were the major polyamine. A phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison showed that strain 03SU10-PT formed an evolutionary lineage within the radiation enclosing the members of the genus Roseomonas and its nearest neighbor was Roseomonas stagni (96.3 % sequence similarity). Polyphasic evidence presented in this study indicated that strain 03SU10-PT could not be assigned to any recognized species; therefore a novel species was proposed, Roseomonas riguiloci sp. nov., with 03SU10-PT (=KCTC 23339T =JCM 17520T) as the type strain."
