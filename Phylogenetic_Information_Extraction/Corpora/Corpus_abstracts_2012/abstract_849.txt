A Gram-staining-positive, strictly aerobic, spherical-shaped, non-motile red-pigmented bacterial strain MK03T, was isolated from a soil sample. A polyphasic approach was applied to study the taxonomic position of strain MK03T. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain MK03T belonged to the clade formed by members of the genus Deinococcus in the family Deinococcaceae. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 64.5 mol %. Strain MK03T showed highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Deinococcus aerolatus 5516T-9T (97.4 %), Deinococcus marmoris AA-63 T (97.2 %), Deinococcus radiopugnans ATCC19172 T (97.2 %.) and Deinococcus saxicola AA-1444T (96.9 %), whereas, sequence similarity to other Deinococcus species was less than 96.0 %. The chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain MK03T showed typical features of the genus Deinococcus, with the presence of predominant respiratory quinone as MK-8, the major fatty acids (>12 %) C16:1_7c, C15:1_6c, C16:0 and C15:0, ornithine as diamino acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan and resistance to gamma radiation [D10 (dose required to reduce the bacterial population by 10-fold) >9 kGy]. The low DNA-DNA relatedness values (34.5O1.5-11.6O2.4 %) indicated that strain MK03T represented a distinct species that was separated from other closely related type strains in the genus Deinococcus. On the basis of phylogenetic inference, fatty acid profile and other phenotypic properties, strain MK03T is described as a novel species of the genus Deinococcus, for which the name Deinococcus humi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MK03T (=KCTC 13619T = JCM 17915T).
