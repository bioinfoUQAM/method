We evaluated phylogenetic clustering of bacterial and archaeal communities from redox-dynamic subtropical forest soils, defined by 16S rRNA and rRNA gene sequences. We observed significant clustering for the RNA-based but not the DNA-based communities, as well as increasing clustering over time of the highly-active taxa detected by rRNA only.
