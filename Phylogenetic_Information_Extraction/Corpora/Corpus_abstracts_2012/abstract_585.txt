Thirty HIV-1 URF_01AE/ B' complete or nearly full-length genome sequences sampled within Southeast Asia were obtained from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database. Phylogenetic and recombinant analyses revealed that three sequences indeed displayed the identical recombinant structure. Of note, the three subjects, harboring Novel CRF01_AE/B Recombinants, didn't have apparent epidemiological linkage. They fulfilled the criteria for designation of a new CRF and constituted the 52nd CRF identified in the worldwide HIV-1 pandemic. In this chimera, two short subtype B segments were inserted into a backbone of CRF_01AE. The breakpoints corresponded to HXB2 nucleotide positions 2930, 3251, 8521 and 9004 approximately. This CRF is the first one identified by neatening and analyzing the sequences already presented on the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database. This highlights that we should pay attention not only to explicit subtypes sequences but also to those classified as URF so far.
