As an important pest in the Slender Leaved Willow (Salix alba), Apatura metis is called Freyer's purple emperor, and its mitochondrial genome is 15,236'bp long. The encoded genes for 22 tRNA genes, two ribosomal RNA (rrnL and rrnS) genes, and 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), and a control region in the A. metis mitochondria are highly homologous to other lepidopteran species. The mitochondrial genome of A. metis is biased toward a high A'+'T content (A'+'T'='80.5%). All protein-coding genes, except for COI begins with the CGA codon as observed in other lepidopterans, start with a typical ATN initiation codon. All tRNAs show the classic clover-leaf structure, except that the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm of tRNA ( Ser(AGN)) forms a simple loop. The A. metis A'+'T-rich region contains some conserved structures including a structure combining the motif 'ATAGA' and 19'bp poly (T) stretch, which is similar to those found in other lepidopteran mitogenomes. The phylogenetic analyses of lepidopterans based on mitogenomes sequences demonstrate that each of the six superfamilies is monophyletic, and the relationship among them is (((Noctuoidea'+'(Geometroidea'+'Bombycoidea))'+'Pyraloidea)'+'Papilionoidea)'+'Tortricoidea. In Papilionoidea group, our conclusion argues that ((Lycaenidae'+'Pieridae)'+'Nymphalidae)'+'Papilionidae.
