A global phylogeny for the Chelonid Fibropapilloma-associated Herpesvirus, the most likely etiological agent of fibropapillomatosis in sea turtles, was inferred, using dated sequences, through Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, and used to 1) estimate the virus evolutionary rate independently of host's evolution, and 2) resolve the phylogenetic positions of new haplotypes from Puerto Rico and Gulf of Guinea. We identified four phylogeographic groups: the eastern Pacific, the western Atlantic/eastern Caribbean, the mid-west Pacific and the Atlantic. The latter is comprised by Gulf of Guinea and Puerto Rico, suggesting recent virus gene flow between these two regions. One virus haplotype from Florida remains elusive, either representing an independent lineage sharing a common ancestor with all other identified virus variants, or an Atlantic representative of the lineage giving rise to the eastern Pacific group. The virus evolutionary rate ranged from 1.62 to 2.22 x 10-4 substitutions per site per year, which is much faster than what was expected for an herpesvirus. The mean time for the most recent common ancestor of the modern virus variants was estimated at 192.90 to 429.71 years ago, which although more recent than previous estimates, still supports an interpretation that the global FP pandemic is not the result of a recent acquisition of virulence mutation(s). The phylogeographic pattern obtained seems to reflect partially sea turtle movements whereas altered environments appear to be implicated in current fibropapillomatosis outbreaks and in the modern evolutionary history of the Chelonid Fibropapilloma-associated Herpesvirus.
