The bla(CTX-M-15) gene was found on F31:A4:B1/IncFII and F2:A-:B-/IncFII plasmids, which have been reported abundantly in humans. On F31:A4:B1/IncFII plasmids, the bla(CTX-M-15) gene was associated with the bla(TEM-1), bla(OXA-1) and aac(6')-Ib-cr resistance genes. The bla(CTX-M-15) gene was also found on IncI1 plasmids of the CC31 clonal complex, recently identified in the human epidemic and virulent E. coli clone O104:H4. None of the cattle isolates belonged to the human and widespread clone B2-O25b:H4/ST131, but were mostly of new STs and of the phylogenetic groups A (n_=_4), B1 (n_=_3) or D (n_=_2). The E. coli isolates harbouring the bla(CTX-M-15)-carrying plasmids were genetically diverse, and were recovered from different geographical locations and farms and at different times.
