Myostatin (MSTN) is a member of the transforming growth factor-_ superfamily which could play an important role in negatively regulating skeletal muscle growth and development in mammal and non-mammal species. In the present study, a MSTN1 gene (designated as VvMSTN1) was cloned and characterized in one flatfish species, spotted halibut (Verasper variegatus). In the 3078bp genomic sequence, three exons, two introns and a promoter sequence were identified. Sequence analysis of the promoter region revealed that it contained several cis-regulatory elements such as CAAT-box, TATA-box and E-boxes. The deduced protein sequence included a signal peptide, a TGF-_ propeptide in the N-terminal region and the TGF-_ active peptide in the C-terminal region. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that VvMSTN1 is an orthologue of teleost MSTN1 proteins which arose along with MSTN2 during a duplication event at the base of teleost evolution. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that VvMSTN1 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all nine tested tissues, with the most transcriptionally abundant in skeletal muscle. A primary assessment of sequence variability revealed five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) existed in the promoter region, among which three (G-653T, T-355C and G-253A) were genotyped with an advanced melting temperature (T(m))-shift method and tested for their association with growth traits (body length, body depth and total mass). Results indicated that genotype CC of locus T-355C had significantly higher growth traits than genotype TC and TT (P<0.05) in female spotted halibut. These results suggest that V. variegatus MSTN could be selected as a candidate gene for the future molecular breeding of stains with enhanced individual growth performance.
