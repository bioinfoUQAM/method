Of the 1451 tissue samples from the dogs' brain, 31 were positive under DFA and the positive rate was 2.14%. The DFA positive samples were redetected by RT-PCR and the positive rate was 1.17%. 56 samples of saliva, serum and urine samples were detected by RT-PCR from the rabies patients, with 3 positives and the positive rate was 5.36%. The length of nest PCR products were 255 bp. The rates of homology to the nucleotide and the amino acid of rabies N gene were 87.2% - 87.9% after compared to the pasture strain. The phylogenetic tree was successfully built and 20 strains isolated lately belonged to the rabies gene type I.
