A novel actinobacterial strain, MBRL 353T, was isolated from a sample collected from a limestone quarry at Hundung, Manipur, India. The strain was characterized using polyphasic taxonomy. Comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences of strain MBRL 353T and other Rhodococcus species showed sequence similarities ranging from 95.5 to 98.2%, while phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain MBRL 353T showed closest similarity to Rhodococcus triatomae IMMIB RIV-085T (98.2%) and Rhodococcus equi DSM 20307T (97.2%). DNA-DNA hybridization results, however, revealed that the DNA relatedness between MBRL 353T and type strains of R. triatomae DSM 44892T (43.4%) and R. equi DSM 20307T (33.4%) were well below the 70% delineating limit for species identification. Strain MBRL 353T contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid, with galactose and arabinose in cell-wall hydrolysates. Mycolic acids were present. The major fatty acids were C16:0 (45.7%), C18:1_9c (18.2%) and 10-methyl C18:0 (11.3%). The only menaquinone detected was MK-8(H2), while the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM) and one unknown phospholipids (PL). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 69.2%. The phenotypic and genotypic data showed that strain MBRL 353T merits the recognition as a representative of a novel species of the genus Rhodococcus. It is proposed that the isolate should be classified in the genus Rhodococcus as a novel species Rhodococcus canchipurensis sp. nov. The type strain is MBRL 353T (=KCTC 19851T = JCM 17578T).
