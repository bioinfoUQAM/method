Three Gram-positive isolates originating from air of a medical practice (strains WS4601T, WS4602) and a pharmaceutical clean room (strain WS4599) were characterized using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene and recA sequences of the three strains showed that they form a distinct lineage within the genus Micrococcus, sharing 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between 96.1 and 98.0% with other species of this genus. Chemotaxonomic features also supported the classification of the three strains within the genus Micrococcus. The major cellular fatty acids of the type strain were anteiso-C15:0 and iso-C15:0, the cell-wall peptidoglycan was of the type A3_(L-Lys-L-Ala) and the predominant respiratory quinones were MK7(H2) and MK8(H2). The polar lipid profile contained diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol, but no phosphatidylinositol. The mol% G+C content of the genomic DNA was 70.4%. Numerous physiological properties were found that clearly distinguished strains WS4599, WS4601T and WS4602 from known Micrococcus species. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic data, strains WS4599, WS4601T and WS4602 are considered to represent three different strains of a novel species of the genus Micrococcus, for which the name Micrococcus cohnii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WS4601T (= DSM 23974T = LMG 26183T).
