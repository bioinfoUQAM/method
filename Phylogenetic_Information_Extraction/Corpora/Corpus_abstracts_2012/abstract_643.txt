A PAH-degrading strain TVG9-VII was isolated from the hydrothermal chimney sample of the Lau basin in Southwest Pacific Ocean. It showed 99.7% similarities with 16S rRNA gene of Novosphingobium indicum strain H25(T). The degradation rates of this strain against phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene were 95.2%, 57.3% and 69.6% in 21 days, respectively. A gene cluster, containing PAHs initial dioxygenase genes pheA1a and pheA1b, was obtained from genomic fosmid library, with the insertion size of 12.522 kb. The gene pheA1a was enhanced by 4.2 folds in mRNA expression in presence of phenanthrene, but expression enhancement was not observed in other tested PAHs including naphthalene, pyrene and fluoranthene.
