Two novel bacteria, which are Gram-positive, aerobic, non-sporulating, short rods to cocci-shaped, were isolated from Takalima desert. These bacteria can oxidize manganese ions. The 16S rDNA sequences of the two isolates share 95.4%-98.0% homology with the type strains of the genus Mycetocola. Although the two bacteria possess similar chemotaxonomic properties with the species M. reblochoni, they were readily distinguished from this taxon based on DNA-DNA relatedness, and phenotypic data. According to their morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis and DNA hybridization results, the two novel isolates are classified into the genus Mycetocola. They represent two members of a novel species which was referred to as Mycetocola manganoxydans sp. nov. The type strain is MB1-14T (=CCTCC AB209002T= KCTC 19753T).
