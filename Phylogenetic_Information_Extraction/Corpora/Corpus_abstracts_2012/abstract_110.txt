Two genotypes of rubella virus had circulated in Zhejiang province during 2005 to 2010. Genotype 1E appeared to be the predominant genotype and 2B being an imported one. Amino acid sequence of E1 gene from Zhejiang rubella strains was comparatively conserved, but E2 gene was hypervariable. Study on rubella virus E2 and C gene should be conducted in the epidemiological surveillance program of rubella.
