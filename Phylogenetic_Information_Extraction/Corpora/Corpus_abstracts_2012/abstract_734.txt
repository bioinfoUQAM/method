L-type lectins have a leguminous lectin domain and can bind to high-mannose type oligosaccharides. In the secretory pathway, L-type lectins play crucial roles in selective protein trafficking, sorting and targeting. Three L-type lectins were cloned in the channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, the 53'kDa endoplasmic reticulum ER-Golgi intermediate compartment protein (ERGIC-53), the vesicular integral protein of 36'kDa (VIP36) and VIP36-like. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the catfish genes are orthologous to their counterparts in other species. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that all three L-type lectin genes are likely single-copy genes in the catfish genome. Analysis of expression in healthy tissues using quantitative real time RT-PCR indicated that all three genes are expressed widely in all tested tissues, but with strong tissue preference of expression: ERGIC-53 was found to be abundantly expressed in the liver, VIP36 was found to be abundantly expressed in the head-kidney, whereas VIP36-like was found to be abundantly expressed in the brain. Upon infection with Edwardsiella ictaluri, expressions of the three genes all had significant up-regulation in the head-kidney, but had distinct expression patterns: ERGIC-53 was gradually induced with the highest expression 7 days after challenge in the head-kidney, but was down-regulated in the liver, spleen, and brain. VIP36 was highly induced in the head-kidney, and 3 days after challenge in the brain, but was not up-regulated in any other tissues or timepoints after challenge. Expression levels of the catfish VIP36-like gene appeared to also respond to infection, albeit with differing patterns among the tested tissues. Taken together, our results indicate that all three L-type lectin genes may be involved in the immune responses of catfish after infection with E.'ictaluri.
