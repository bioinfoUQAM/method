A Gram-positive, non-motile, non-spore forming actinobacterium designated strain Sua-BAC020T, was isolated from brine from Sua salt pan in Botswana. The strain was alkaliphilic and moderately halophilic, displaying optimal growth at 35 - 37 'C, pH 9 and 2.5% (w/v) NaCl. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain Sua-BAC020T belonged to the genus Nesterenkonia, sharing 96.2 - 99.0% sequence similarity with the type strains of published species within this genus. DNA-DNA hybridization with the species that showed the closest phylogenetic affiliation, Nesterenkonia xinjiangensis (16S rRNA similarity, 98.9%), Nesterenkonia aethiopica (99.0%), Nesterenkonia halophila (97.5%), Nesterenkonia flava (97.4%) and Nesterenkonia halobia (97.2%), gave relatedness values of 10 - 45%. The peptidoglycan type of strain Sua-BAC020T was A4_, L-Lys-Gly-D-Asp. Cells of the isolate contained phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and unidentified glycolipids, as major polar lipids, MK-8, MK-9 and MK-7 were the predominant menaquinones, and the major fatty acids (> 10%) were anteiso-C15:0 and anteiso-C17:0. The DNA G + C content was 64.8 mol%. Based on DNA-DNA hybridization, physiological and biochemical tests strain Sua-BAC020T is distinct from the 11 published Nesterenkonia species, suggesting that this strain represents a new species for which the name Nesterenkonia suensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain Sua-BAC020T (=DSM 22748T = NCCB 100309T).
