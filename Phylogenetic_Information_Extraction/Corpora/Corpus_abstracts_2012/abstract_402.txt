Here, we describe a transmission event of hepatitis C virus (HCV) among injection drug users. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was used to assess the intra-host viral genetic variation. Deep amplicon sequencing of the HCV hypervariable region-1 allowed a detailed analysis of the structure of the viral population. Establishment of the genetic relatedness between cases was accomplished by phylogenetic analysis. NGS is a powerful tool with applications in molecular epidemiology studies and outbreak investigations.
