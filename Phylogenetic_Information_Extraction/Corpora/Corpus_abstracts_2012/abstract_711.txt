Comparative endocrinology is a fascinating field of science in part because it addresses both ultimate and proximate causation. Research on sexual dimorphism and sexual differentiation has excellent potential for this kind of integration. Vertebrate comparative endocrinologists have made many important discoveries about the role of genes and sex steroid hormones in the organization and activation of sexually differentiated behavior, brain function, anatomy and physiology. In addition to taxonomically general principles and conserved features, there is also striking diversity in sexual differentiation processes. Much of the evolutionary basis of this diversity (its phylogenetic history and adaptive functions) is not well understood. A set of questions is raised to illustrate this point, with an emphasis on mechanisms of sexual dimorphism in body size and ornamentation, sexual differentiation of avian behavior, particularly in Japanese quail and zebra finches, and the puzzle of the phylogenetic distribution of vertebrate sex determining mechanisms. Applying a comparative approach grounded in established phylogenies and concepts from evolutionary developmental biology such as developmental modules holds promise for generating and testing new hypotheses and eventually answering some of these questions.
