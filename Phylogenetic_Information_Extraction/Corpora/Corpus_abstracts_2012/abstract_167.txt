Clin Microbiol Infect ABSTRACT: Plasmid-mediated AmpC _-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (AmpC-E) bacteraemia was characterized by comparison with bacteraemia caused by extended-spectrum _-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E.'coli (ESBL-E) and non-resistant E.'coli (NR-E) in the era of the worldwide spread of the CTX-M-15-producing O25b-ST131-B2 clone. Of 706 bloodstream E.'coli isolates collected between 2005 and 2010 in three Japanese university hospitals, 111 ESBL screening-positive isolates were analysed for AmpC and ESBL genes by PCR. A case-control study was performed in which the cases consisted of all of the patients with AmpC-E bacteraemia. Phylogenetic groups, sequence types and O25b serotype were determined. Twenty-seven AmpC-E isolates (26 of which were of the CMY-2 type) were identified, and 54 ESBL-E and 54 NR-E isolates were selected for the controls. Nineteen AmpC-E isolates were also positive for ESBL. CTX-M-14 was the most prevalent ESBL type among both the AmpC-E and ESBL-E isolates. The O25b-ST131-B2 clone was the most prevalent among the ESBL-E isolates (26%) and the second most prevalent among the NR-E isolates (13%), but only one O25b-ST131-B2 clone was found among the AmpC-E isolates. Twenty-three different sequence types were identified among the AmpC-E isolates. When compared with bacteraemia with ESBL-E, previous isolation of multidrug-resistant bacteria and intravascular catheterization were independently associated with a lower risk for AmpC-E. When compared with NR-E bacteraemia, prior use of antibiotics was the only significant risk factor for AmpC-E. Unlike the spread of the O25b-ST131-B2 clone between ESBL-E and NR-E, the AmpC-E isolates were not dominated by any specific clone.
