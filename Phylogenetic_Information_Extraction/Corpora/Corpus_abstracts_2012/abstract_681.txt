A SNP comparative analysis of rhizome-derived cDNA sequences was successfully utilized to distinguish three Miscanthus u giganteus cultivars from each other and from other Miscanthus species. Moreover, the resulting phylogenetic tree generated from SNP frequency data parallels the known breeding history of the plants examined. Some of the giant miscanthus plants exhibit considerable sequence divergence.
