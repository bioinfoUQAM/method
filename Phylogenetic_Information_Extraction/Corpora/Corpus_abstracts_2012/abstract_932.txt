Previously, reports have demonstrated that genotypes A1, A2, B1 and B2 circulate every season, usually with one dominant strain. In contrast, late in the 2009-2010 respiratory season, 4 of the 5 recognized genotypes of hMPV were isolated from NYS ILI patients, and by sequencing a larger portion of the fusion gene, we were able to identify the A2a and A2b genotypes.
