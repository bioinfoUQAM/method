The ultrastructure of the fish-infecting microsporidium Spraguea gastrophysus found in the dorsal ganglia and kidney of the anglerfish, Lophius gastrophysus (family Lophiidae) collected on the Brazilian Atlantic coast is described. Each whitish xenoma (up to 3.1_u_1.8'mm) contains several groups of parasites. The host cells are hypertrophied and contain various parasite life stages including mature spores and several developmental stages with unpaired nuclei. Monomorphic spores are ellipsoidal, lightly curved and measure about 3.35_u_1.71'_m. The spore contains a gradually tapering isofilar polar filament with five to six coils arranged in a single row. The nucleus occupies a central zone of the sporoplasm where also several polyribosomes are presented. The posterior vacuole contains a voluminous spherical and granular posterosome measuring up to ~0.65'_m in diameter. The partial small subunit, intergenic spacer and partial large subunit rRNA gene were sequenced and the phylogenetic analysis places the microsporidian described here in the clade that includes all sequences of the Spraguea genus. The ultrastructural morphology of the xenoma and the spores of this microsporidian parasite, as well as the molecular and phylogenetic analysis, suggest the description of a new species. A redefining of the genus Spraguea is also done.
