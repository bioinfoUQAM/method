In order to determine the bacterial diversity and the identity of rhizobia nodulating lentil in Bangladesh, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of housekeeping genes (16S rRNA, recA, atpD and glnII) and nodulation genes (nodC, nodD and nodA) of 36 bacterial isolates from 25 localities across the country. Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses based on 16S rRNA sequences showed that most of the isolates (30 out of 36) were related to Rhizobium etli and Rhizobium leguminosarum. Only these thirty isolates were able to re-nodulate lentil under laboratory conditions. The protein-coding housekeeping genes of the lentil nodulating isolates showed 89.1-94.8% genetic similarity to the corresponding genes of R. etli and R. leguminosarum. The same analyses showed that they split into three distinct phylogenetic clades. The distinctness of these clades from closely related species was also supported by high resolution ERIC-PCR fingerprinting and phenotypic characteristics such as temperature tolerance, growth on acid-alkaline media (pH 5.5-10.0) and antibiotic sensitivity. Our phylogenetic analyses based on three nodulation genes (nodA, nodC and nodD) and cross-inoculation assays confirmed that the nodulation genes are related to those of R. leguminosarum biovar viciae, but clustered in a distinct group supported by high bootstrap values. Thus, our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis, DNA fingerprinting and phenotypic characterizations suggest that at least three different clades are responsible for lentil nodulation in Bangladesh. These clades differ from the R. etli-R. leguminosarum group and may correspond to novel species in the genus Rhizobium.
