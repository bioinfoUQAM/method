A novel strain of Flavobacterium, DCY55(T), a Gram-negative, yellow-pigmented, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming and gliding-motile bacterium, was isolated from the soil of a ginseng field in South Korea. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the 16S rRNA sequence, demonstrated that strain DCY55(T) belongs to the genus Flavobacterium within the family Flavobacteriaceae. Strain DCY55(T) showed the highest similarity with F. johnsoniae UW101(T) (97.1%), F. ginsenosidimutans THG 01(T) (96.8%), F. defluvii EMB 117(T) (96.6%), F. banpakuense 15F3(T) (96.3%) and F. anhuiense D3(T) (95.8%). Chemotaxonomic results showed that strain DCY55(T) predominantly contains menaquinone MK-6, that its DNA G+C content is 36.1mol%, and that its major cellular fatty acids are iso-C(15:0), summed feature 3 (comprising iso-C(15:0) 2-OH and/or C(16:1) _ 7c) and C(16:0). The chemotaxonomic and genotypic characteristics support the taxonomic classification of strain DCY55(T) to the genus Flavobacterium. The results of physiological and biochemical tests confirmed that strain DCY55(T) is distinct from previously validated species. We conclude that strain DCY55(T) should be classified as a novel species of the genus Flavobacterium, for which the name Flavobacterium ginsengiterrae sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain DCY55(T) (=KCTC 23319(T) = JCM 17337(T)).
