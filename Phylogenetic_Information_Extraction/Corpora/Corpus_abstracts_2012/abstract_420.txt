The complete mitogenome sequence of the spotted steed (Hemibarbus maculatus) was determined using long PCR reactions. The genome is 16,611'bp long and consists of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and a control region. The gene order and composition of H. maculatus was similar to that of most other vertebrates. The base composition of H-strand in descending order is A (29.16%), C (27.41%), T (25.93%), and G (17.50%), with an AT content of 55.09%. The Kimura two-parameter distances between mitogenome sequences of H. maculatus and Hemibarbus labeo, Hemibarbus barbus, Hemibarbus longirostris, Hemibarbus mylodon were 2.09%, 2.35%, 12.77%, and 13.92%, respectively. The phylogenetic relationships among the five Hemibarbus species based on the whole mitogenome sequence data were (((H. barbus, H. labeo), H. maculatus), (H. longirostris, H. mylodon)).
