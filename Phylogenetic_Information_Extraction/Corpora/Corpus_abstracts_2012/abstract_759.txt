We determined the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the compactin-producing fungus Penicillium solitum strain 20-01. The 28'601-base pair circular-mapping DNA molecule encodes a characteristic set of mitochondrial proteins and RNA genes and is intron-free. All 46 protein- and RNA-encoding genes are located on one strand and apparently transcribed in one direction. Comparative analysis of this mtDNA and previously sequenced but unannotated mitochondrial genomes of several medically and industrially important species of the Aspergillus/Penicillium group revealed their extensive similarity in terms of size, gene content and sequence, which is also reflected in the almost perfect conservation of mitochondrial gene order in Penicillium and Aspergillus. Phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated mitochondrial protein sequences confirmed the monophyletic origin of Eurotiomycetes.
