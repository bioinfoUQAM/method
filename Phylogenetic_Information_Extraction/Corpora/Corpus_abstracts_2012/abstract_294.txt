Investigating the evolutionary relationships of the major groups of Apicomplexa remains an important area of study. Morphological features and host-parasite relationships continue to be important in the systematics of the adeleorinid coccidia (suborder Adeleorina), but the systematics of these parasites have not been well-supported or have been constrained by data that were lacking or difficult to interpret. Previous phylogenetic studies of the Adeleorina have been based on morphological and developmental characters of several well-described species or based on nuclear 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences from taxa of limited taxonomic diversity. Twelve new 18S rDNA sequences from adeleorinid coccidia were combined with published sequences to study the molecular phylogeny of taxa within the Adeleorina and to investigate the evolutionary relationships of adeleorinid parasites within the Apicomplexa. Three phylogenetic methods supported strongly that the suborder Adeleorina formed a monophyletic clade within the Apicomplexa. Most widely recognized families within the Adeleorina were hypothesized to be monophyletic in all analyses, although the single Hemolivia species included in the analyses was the sister taxon to a Hepatozoon sp. within a larger clade that contained all other Hepatozoon spp. making the family Hepatozoidae paraphyletic. There was an apparent relationship between the various clades generated by the analyses and the definitive (invertebrate) host parasitized and, to lesser extent, the type of intermediate (vertebrate) host exploited by the adeleorinid parasites. We conclude that additional taxon sampling and use of other genetic markers apart from 18S rDNA will be required to better resolve relationships among these parasites.
