Strain HMTS15 was Gram-positive rod. Its growth pH ranged from 7.0 to 11.0 and growth temperature ranged from 10 degrees C to 45 degrees C. The G + C content of the DNA was 40 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicated that strain HMTS15 was a member of Bacillus. The extracellular mannanase from strain HMTS15 was purified as a single band with molecular weight of about 45 kD on SDS-PAGE. The optimal catalytic activity was showed at 75 degrees C and pH 10. The mananase was stable up to 60 degrees C and retained about 60% residual activity at 65 degrees C for 30 min. The ions Fe2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Ag+, Hg2+ and EDTA inhibited the acitivity of the mannanase.
