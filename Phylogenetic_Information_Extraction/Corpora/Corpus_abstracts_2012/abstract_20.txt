Fusarium equiseti (Corda) Saccardo is a soil saprophyte and a weak pathogen, associated with several diseases of fruit and other crops in subtropical and tropical areas, but also in countries with temperate climate. A wide range of secondary metabolites has been identified among natural F. equiseti populations, with zearalenone (ZEA), fusarochromanone and fusarenon-X being the most common. In present study, the genetic diversity of strains from two populations (from Italy and Poland) was evaluated by analysing the translation elongation factor 1_ (tef-1_) sequences, two polyketide synthases from the ZEA biosynthetic pathway (PKS13 and PKS4) and the TRI5 gene from the trichothecene biosynthetic pathway. ZEA was produced in rice cultures by 20 of the 27 tested isolates in concentrations ranging from 1.34'ng/g to 34,000'ng/g). The ability to produce enniatins and trichothecenes was evaluated in all strains by identifying esyn1, TRI13 and TRI4 genes. The presence of PKS4 and PKS13 genes was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in only some ZEA-producing isolates. Similarly, the TRI5 gene was found in 14 of the 27 isolates tested. This is likely to have been caused by the divergence of those genes between F. equiseti and F. graminearum (the latter species was used for the primers design) and can be exploited in phylogenetic studies. The analysis of the mycotoxin biosynthetic gene sequences can be used to differentiate the studied genotypes even more precisely than the analysis of the non-coding regions (like tef-1_).
