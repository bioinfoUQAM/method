"The existence of four dengue serotypes is associated with a phenomenon called ""Antibody-Dependent Enhancement"" that has been suggested to cause a severe form of dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. To study the evolutionary event that drove the serotype separation, we employed the maximum likelihood approach by focusing on the Premembrane (prM) and Envelop (E) genes. We showed that the separation of dengue serotypes had been dominantly under purifying selection. In spite of the strong selective constraint, one codon of prM gene and twelve codons of E gene were detected to be under positive selection. This indicates that the E protein might have been under a stronger positive pressure than the PrM protein. The codons under positive selection were identified along the interserotypic branches, suggesting that changes at these sites were probably associated with the emergence of the four serotypes and/or adaptation to the new transmission environments."
