This paper reports the design and the synthesis of a new family of compounds, the phostines, belonging to the [1,2]oxaphosphinane family. Twenty-six compounds have been screened for their antiproliferative activity against a large panel of NCI cancer cell lines. Because of its easy synthesis and low EC(50) value (500 nM against the C6 rat glioma cell line), compound 3.1a was selected for further biological study. Moreover, the specific biological effect of 3.1a on the glioblastoma phylogenetic cluster from the NCI is dependent on its stereochemistry. Within that cluster, 3.1a has a higher antiproliferative activity than Temozolomide and is more potent than paclitaxel for the SF295 and SNB75 cell lines. In constrast with paclitaxel and vincristine, 3.1a is devoid of astrocyte toxicity. The original activity spectrum of 3.1a on the NCI cancer cell line panel allows the development of this family for use in association with existing drugs, opening new therapeutic perspectives.
