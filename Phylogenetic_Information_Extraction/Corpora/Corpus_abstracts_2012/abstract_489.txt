Three actinobacterial strains, CR30T, CR36 and CR38T were isolated from the rhizosphere soil of Pisum sativum plants collected in Spain. The strains were filamentous, Gram-positive and produced single spores. Phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and morphological analyses confirmed that the three strains belonged to the genus Micromonospora. 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains CR30T and CR36 showed closest relationship with Micromonospora coriariae NAR01T (99.3% similarity) while strain CR38T had a similarity of 99.0% with Micromonospora saelicesensis Lupac 09T. In addition, gyrB gene phylogeny clearly differentiated the new isolates from established Micromonospora species. DNA-DNA hybridization, BOX PCR and ARDRA profiles confirmed that these strains represent new genomic species. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strains CR30T and CR38T contained meso-DAP. Both strains had MK-10(H4) as the main menaquinone and a phospholipid type II pattern. An array of physiological tests also differentiated the new isolates from their closest neighbours. Considering all the data obtained, it is proposed that strains CR30T and CR36 represent a new species under the name Micromonospora cremea sp. nov. (type strain CR30T = CECT 7891T = DSM 45599T), while the name Micromonospora zamorensis sp. nov. is proposed with isolate CR38T (= CECT 7892T = DSM 45600T) as the type strain.
