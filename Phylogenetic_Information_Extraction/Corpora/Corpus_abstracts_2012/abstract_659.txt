Among the 3800 bacteria isolated from the 187 soil samples, 196 isolates(5.16% of the total) showed attractive activity (AN)more than 30% to Panagrellus redivivus. Of the 196 isolates, 66 (1.74%) showed AN > or = 70%, 62 isolates (1.63%) showed AN between 50% and 70%, and 68 isolates (1.79%) showed AN less than 50%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 196 bacteria were clustered into 5 groups: Bacilli, Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Sphingobacteria and Actinobacteria. But, Bacillus were the dominant, which covered 13 species. And 11 volatiles with nematode-attracting activity were determined, including benzaldehyde, 2-heptanone, benzyl benzoate, ethyl palmitate, (+)-longifolene, benzyl alcohol, p-anisaldehyde, vanatone, ethyl butyrate, isovanilin and d-alaninol.
