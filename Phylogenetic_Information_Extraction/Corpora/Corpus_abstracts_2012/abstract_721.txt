Marked Norovirus (NoV) diversity was detected in patient samples from a large community outbreak of gastroenteritis with waterborne epidemiology affecting approximately 2400 people. NoV was detected in 33 of 50 patient samples examined by group-specific real-time RT-PCR. NoV genotype (G)I strains predominated in 31 patients with mixed GI infections occurring in five of these patients. Sequence-analysis of RNA-dependent polymerase-N/S capsid-coding regions (approx. 900 nt) confirmed dominance of GI strains (n=36). Strains of NoV GI.4 (n=21), and GI.7 (n=9) were identified, but 6 strains required full capsid amino acid analyses (530-550 aa,) before definitive genotyping based on control sequencing of cloned amplicons. Three strains were assigned to a new NoV GI genotype, proposed GI.9, on capsid aa analyses showing 26% dissimilarity from established genotypes GI.1 to GI.8. Three other strains placed in a sub-branch of GI.3 with 13-15% aa dissimilarity to GI.3 GenBank reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis (2.1 kb) of ten representative strains confirmed genotype clusters. Strains of NoV GII.4 (n=1), NoV GII.6 (n=2), Sapovirus GII.2 (n=1), Rotavirus (n=3), Adenovirus (n=1) and Campylobacter spp. (n=2) were detected as single infections, or as mixtures with NoV GI. Marked NoV GI diversity detected in patients was consistent with epidemiologic evidence of waterborne NoV infections, suggesting human faecal contamination of the water supply. Recognition of NoV diversity in a cluster of patients provided a useful warning marker of waterborne contamination in the Lilla Edet outbreak.
