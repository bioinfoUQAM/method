"We describe a new tiny naked centrohelid heliozoan, Oxnerella micra, and sequenced its 18S and 28S rRNA genes. Its extremely slender axopodia have prominent extrusomes and are normally stretched across the substratum like those of many tiny granofilosean Cercozoa. Phylogenetic analysis of 18S rDNA shows that Oxnerella does not branch within any of the six known centrohelid families but very deeply in the order Pterocystida, between Choanocystidae and Pterocystidae; therefore we place it in a new family, Oxnerellidae. Oxnerella arose from ancestors with siliceous scales by losing them; as independently did Heterophryidae and Marophryidae, which replaced them by organic spicules, and Chlamydaster that is not truly naked but retains a mucilage coat and nests extremely shallowly within Pterocystidae. 28S rDNA has a group I intron. Concatenated Bayesian 18S/28S rRNA phylogeny shows centrohelids weakly as sisters to the naked non-centrohelid heliozoan Microheliella maris (Microhelida: Heliozoa). The centrohelid Marophrys marina possesses an elongation factor _-like (EFL) protein related to that of Polyplacocystis; Microheliella also has EFL. We also analysed Hsp90 and 18S rDNA sequences from 'Pinaciophora sp.' ATCC50355; they must be from a centrohelid, probably misidentified as Pinaciophora, the rDNA sequence branching deeply within Pterocystida. We reclassify two Polyplacocystis, Luffisphaera, Phaeodaria and Rotosphaerida."
