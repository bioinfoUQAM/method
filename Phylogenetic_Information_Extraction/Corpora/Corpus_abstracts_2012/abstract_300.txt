"The study of basic biological properties of H5N1 subtype strain isolated during an outbreak among wild birds in Russia in 2010 was presented. The study was carried out using conventional methods according to the WHO recommendations. H5N1 influenza virus isolated in Siberia belonged to clade 2.3.2 of the hemagglutinin gene; the phylogenetic analysis was performed. The antigenic characteristics and the basic genetic markers of biological properties were studied. It was shown that all strains were highly pathogenic for chickens and white mice. Thus, it was shown that in Russia in the 2010 H5N1 virus phylogenetically closely related to Asian variants caused epizootic among wild birds. The potential danger of this variant of the virus for humans was confirmed by different methods. We discussed the possibility of formation of H5N1 influenza natural focus."
