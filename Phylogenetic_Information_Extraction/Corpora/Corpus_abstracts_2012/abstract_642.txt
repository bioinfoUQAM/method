"The phylogeny was studied by 16S rRNA gene clone, and the degradation rates against different PAHs were determined by GC-MS. Meanwhile, PAH-degrading gene cluster was cloned by the genomic Fosmid library construction; the function of the key degrading-gene expression was examined by RT-PCR and qPCR to observe gene expression in the response to different PAHs."
