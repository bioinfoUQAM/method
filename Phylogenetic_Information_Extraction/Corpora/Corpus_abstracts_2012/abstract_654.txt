One hundred sediment samples were collected from south of the Baltic Sea, of which 809 purified cultures of actinomycetes were obtained by using 7 media. The phylogenetic analysis of 280 selected strains based on 16S rRNA gene sequences was carried out. In addition, activities of 21 enzymes, which play a role in metabolic processes, and anti-microbial activities were determined.
