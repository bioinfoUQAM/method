A gram-negative, motile, non-spore-forming, short rod-shaped (0.8-1.5 u 1.5-2.0 Em), halophilic bacterial strain, NTU-107T, was isolated from brine samples collected from Beimen saltern in southern Taiwan. The growth of this strain occurred at NaCl concentrations of 0-15% (optimum, 5-10%), temperature 15-55 'C (optimum, 40'C) and pH 5.5-9.5 (optimum, 7.5). The major cellular fatty acids were C18:1_7c, C16:0 and C19:0_8c cyclo. The DNA content was 66.5 mol% and the predominant ubiquinone was Q-9. The major polar lipids of strain NTU-107 T included phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. A phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed its affiliation to the genus Halomonas. However, the levels of DNA-DNA relatedness values between NTU-107T and the type strains of the most closely related species, Halomonas koreensis, H. organivorans and H. ventosae were 37.6%, 34.8% and 39.5%, respectively. Based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genetic data, strain NTU-107T (=BCRC 17999T=KCTC 22876T=JCM 16084T) was classified as a novel Halomonas species, for which the name Halomonas beimenensis sp. nov. is proposed. The GenBank accession number of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain NTU-107T is EU159469.
