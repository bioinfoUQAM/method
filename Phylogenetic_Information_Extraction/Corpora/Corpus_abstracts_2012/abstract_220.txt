An entomopathogenic, Gram-negative bacterium isolated from a female specimen of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster was taxonomically characterised. Strain L48(T) was strictly aerobic, non-fermentative, oxidase and catalase positive, rod-shaped, and motile due to a polar inserted flagellum. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and three other housekeeping genes placed strain L48 (T) in the Pseudomonas putida phylogenetic group. DNA-DNA hybridisation studies together with phenotypic metabolic tests and MALDI-TOF MS analysis justified the proposal of strain L48(T) as a representative of a novel species, for which the name Pseudomonas entomophila sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is deposited in culture collections under accession numbers CCUG 61470(T) and CECT 7985(T).
