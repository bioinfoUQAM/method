60 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were collected from the suspected patients. Virus strains from the specimens were isolated with RD and Hep-2 cell lines, and identified through neutralization test. VP1 and VP4/VP2 genes of the isolated viruses were sequenced. Both phylogenetic and homological trees were also constructed.
