Plasma from 343 males and 283 females (age range: 15-86 years, mean age: 60) were tested for KSHV latent antibodies by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using BC-3 cells. DNAs extracted from peripheral blood buffy-coat of KSHV seropositive individuals were amplified to obtain a 737-bp fragment of the ORF-K1 gene. Phylogenetic analyses were then performed.
