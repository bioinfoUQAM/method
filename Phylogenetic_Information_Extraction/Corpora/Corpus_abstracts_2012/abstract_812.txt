We achieved 25 genotypes with BOX-PCR genomic fingerprinting analysis, indicating that the tested strains had a great diversity at genomic level. The representative bradyrhizobial strains were located in three phylogenic branches with multilocus sequence analysis (niffH, nodC and recA gene), that was closely related to Bradyrhizobium elkanii, Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense, respectively.
