Thirteen strains isolated from virgin olive oil or its by-products in several Mediterranean countries were found phenotypically and genetically divergent from currently recognised yeast species. Sequence analysis of the large subunit (LSU) rDNA D1/D2 domain and internal transcribed spacer regions with 5.8S rRNA gene revealed that the strains represented two novel species described as Candida adriatica sp. nov. (ZIM 2234T, CBS 12504T) and Candida molendinolei sp. nov. (DBVPG 5508T, CBS 12508T). Phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated sequences of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, D1/D2 region of the LSU rRNA gene and translation elongation factor-1* gene suggested that C. adriatica sp. nov. and C. molendinolei sp. nov. are placed within Lindnera and Nakazawaea clades, respectively.
