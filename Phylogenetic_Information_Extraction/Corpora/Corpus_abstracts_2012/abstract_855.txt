A novel Gram-positive, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain D94-1T, was isolated from soil selected from Liancheng county of Fujian province, China. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain D94-1T was a member of the genus Nocardioides and closely related to Nocardioides salaries DSM 18239T (98.54 % sequence similarity), Nocardioides marinisabuli DSM 18965T (98.30 %), Nocardioides basaltis DSM 22259T (98.10 %) and Nocardioides dokdonensis KCTC 19309T (97.76 %). Phenotypic characteristics and the DNA-DNA relatedness data served to distinguish strain D94-1T from N. salaries, N. marinisabuli, N. basaltis and N. dokdonensis. The chemotaxonomic properties of strain D94-1T were consistent with those of genus Nocardioides: the cell-wall peptidoglycan type was based on LL-diaminopimelic acid, the predominant menaquinone was MK-8(H4) and the major fatty acids were iso-C16 :0 (29.15 %) and anteiso-C17: 0 (21.0 %). The DNA G + C mol% was 68 %. On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, strain D94-1T represents a novel species of the genus Nocardioides, for which the name Nocardioides lianchengensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is D94-1T (=DSM 24663T =CGMCC 4.6858T).
