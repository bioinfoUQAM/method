Plasmid DNA was analysed using PCR-based replicon typing and plasmid sub-typing schemes, restriction fragment length polymorphism, S1 nuclease-PFGE and Southern hybridization. Strains were characterized by PFGE, multilocus sequence typing, phylogenetic grouping and B2-O25b:H4-ST131 (where ST stands for sequence type) clone screening. Susceptibilities to antimicrobials were determined by agar diffusion and resistance genes were characterized by PCR and sequencing.
