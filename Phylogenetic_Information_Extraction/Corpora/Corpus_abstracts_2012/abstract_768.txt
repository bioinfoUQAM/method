By screening 74 chordate genomes for endogenous lentiviruses using Pol sequences of exogenous lentiviruses as a reference, we identified a novel endogenous lentivirus in the genome of the ferret (Mustela putorius furo). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the ferret endogenous lentivirus, denoted ELVmpf, diverged early in the evolution of the mammalian lentiviruses, although with a lack of resolution at key nodes. These data support the notion that lentiviruses have evolved on timescales of millions of years.
