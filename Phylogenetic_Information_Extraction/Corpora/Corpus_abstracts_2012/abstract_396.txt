Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen protein 3C (EBNA3C) is a 992-amino-acid protein that has been shown to play a complex regulatory role in the transcription of viral and cellular genes. In this study, we successfully amplified 26 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated gastric carcinomas (EBVaGCs), 50 nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) and 27 throat washing (TW) samples from healthy donors. Based on a phylogenetic tree, the samples could be divided into three patterns. 3C-6 was the predominant subtype in northern China, and the variations between the strains sequenced in our study and those from southern China and Japan were similar, but differences were also identified. The distribution of EBNA3C subtypes among EBVaGCs, NPCs and healthy donors was not significantly different. These data suggest that EBNA3C gene variations are geographically restricted rather than tumor-specific polymorphisms.
