Three novel Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacteria were isolated from a cold and alkaline environment. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the strains were almost identical, and that they were related to Natronobacillus azotifigens 24KS-1(T) (95.8% identity), Paraliobacillus quinghaiensis YIM-C158(T) (95.1%), Paraliobacillus ryukyuensis O15-7(T) (94.5%), and Halolactibacillus miurensis M23-1(T) (93.9%). The isolates produced amylase, _-galactosidase, _-galactosidase, and _-glucuronidase, and showed optimal growth at pH 10, at 20'C, and at 2-8% (w/v) NaCl. Major fatty acids were C(14:0) (10.6-11.6%), anteiso-C(15:0) (25.7-32.7%), C(16:1) _11c (12.2-16.0%), and C(16:0) (14.0-20.4%). The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol, and meso-diaminopimelic acid was found in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. The G+C content was 38.4%. DNA-DNA hybridization between strain GCM68(T) and H. miurensis M23-1(T) was 32.4%, while hybridization to N. azotifigens 24KS-1(T), Amphibacillus tropicus Z-7792(T), and Paraliobacillus ryukyuensis O15-7(T) was below 30%. The phylogenetic analysis and G+C content place strain GCM68(T) in relation to species belonging to Bacillus rRNA group 1, but phylogenetic and physiologic data combined with chemotaxonomic analyses support our proposal for a new genus, Alkalilactibacillus, gen. nov., with the novel species Alkalilactibacillus ikkensis, sp. nov. (type strain is GCM68(T)'='DSM 19937'='LMG 24405).
