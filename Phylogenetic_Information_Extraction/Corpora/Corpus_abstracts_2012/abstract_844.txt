A Gram-staining-positive, strictly aerobic, short-rod-shaped and non-motile strain designated MJ32T, was isolated from a sludge sample of the Daejeon sewage disposal plant in South Korea. Polyphasic approach was applied to study the taxonomic position of strain MJ32T. Strain MJ32T showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Gordonia hirsuta DSM 44140T (98.1 %), Gordonia hydrophobica DSM 44015T (97.0 %). Sequence similarities to other 31 Gordonia species was less than 97.0 %. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain MJ32T belonged to the clade formed by members of the genus Gordonia in the family Gordoniaceae. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 69.2 mol %. The chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain MJ32T showed typical features of the genus Gordonia. The predominant respiratory quinone was MK-9 (H2) and the mycolic acid present with C56 - C60 carbon atoms, major fatty acids are C16:0 (34.6 %), tuberculostearic acid (21.8 %), C16:1_7c (19.5 %) and C18:1_9c (12.7 %). The peptidoglycan type is based on meso-2, 6-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid with glycolated sugars. On the basis of phylogenetic inference, fatty acid profile and other phenotypic properties, strain MJ32T is described as a novel species of the genus Gordonia, for which the name Gordonia caeni sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MJ32 T (=KCTC 19771T = JCM 16923T).
