A novel mesophilic, strictly anaerobic bacterium, strain BM(T), was isolated from food industry wastewater. The cells were motile, non-spore-forming rod and stained Gram-negative. Growth of strain BMT was observed at 16-44 'C (optimum 37 'C) and pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum 7.5). The NaCl concentration range for growth was 0-8% (optimum 1.5%, w/v). Strain BM(T) was chemo-organotrophic using a few sugars and amino acids as sole carbon and energy sources. The fermentation products from peptone-yeast broth were propionate, formate, acetate, ethanol and isovalerate. Indole, NH(3) and H(2)S were produced from peptone. No respiratory quinones can be detected. The major fatty acids were iso-C(15:0) (39.3%), iso-C(15:0) DMA (10.1%), anteiso-C(15:0) (7.6%), C(14:0) (6.1%), and C(16:0) (5.6%). The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, aminoglycolipids, glycolipids and phospholipids. The DNA G+C content was 28.2 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain BM(T) was related with different genus belonging to the family Clostridiaceae, and its closest relatives were Sporosalibacterium faouarense JCM 15487(T) (94.3% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Proteiniborus ethanoligenes JCM 14574(T) (92.1%) and Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans JCM 14354(T) (92.0%). Due to its phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, isolate BM(T) is proposed as a novel species of a new genus, Brassicibacter mesophilus gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is BM(T) (=JCM 16868(T)=DSM 24659(T)).
