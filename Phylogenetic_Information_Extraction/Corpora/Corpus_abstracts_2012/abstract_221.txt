Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that a bacterial isolate, designated JC2678(T), represents a distinct phyletic line within the suprageneric monophyletic clade containing the genera Nonlabens, Persicivirga, Stenothermobacter and Sandarakinotalea. The polyphasic data presented in this study demonstrated that the members belonging to the Nonlabens-like clade overall constitute a single genus. Therefore, it is proposed to transfer the members of genera Persicivirga O'Sullivan et al. 2006, Stenothermobacter Lau et al. 2006 and Sandarakinotalea Khan et al. 2006 to the genus Nonlabens Lau et al. 2005. Thus, P. dokdonensis (Yoon et al. 2006) Nedashkovskaya et al. 2009, P. ulvanivorans Barbeyron et al. 2010, P. xylanidelens O'Sullivan et al. 2006, Sandarakinotalea sediminis Khan et al. 2006 and Stenothermobacter spongiae Lau et al. 2006 should be transferred to Nonlabens dokdonensis comb. nov., Nonlabens ulvanivorans comb. nov., Nonlabens xylanidelens comb. nov., Nonlabens sediminis comb. nov. and Nonlabens spongiae comb. nov., respectively. In addition, strain JC2678(T) (=KACC 14155(T)=JCM 17109(T)) is proposed to constitute a novel species belonging to the genus Nonlabens with the name of Nonlabens agnitus sp. nov.
