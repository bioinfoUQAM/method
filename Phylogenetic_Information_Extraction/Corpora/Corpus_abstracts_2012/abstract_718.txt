A Gram-negative, non-motile, cream coloured and rod shaped bacterial strain named LNB2T was isolated from a brick kiln area situated in an open hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) dumpsite at Ummari village (Lucknow, India) and was subjected to polyphasic taxonomic approach. Strain LNB2T showed 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98.0 % with its closest relative Sphingomonas haloaromaticamans A175T and 97.3 % with Sphingomonas histidinilytica UM2T. Strain LNB2T formed a monophyletic group in a cluster comprising of closely related species of the genus Sphingomonas. The DNA-DNA relatedness of strain LNB2T with strain A175T and UM2T was 8.6 % and 5.6 % respectively indicating that strain LNB2T represents a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas. DNA G+C content of strain LNB2T was 61.0 mol %. The predominant fatty acids were 18:1_7c/18:1_6c (39.8 %), 16:0 (16.2 %), 16:1 _7c/16:1 _6c (14.2 %), 14:0 2OH (6.5 %), 17:1 _6c (6.0 %) and 18:1 _7c 11-methyl (5.3 %). Q10 was present as the major ubiquinone. The major polar lipids were found to be diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingoglycolipid (SGL), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine (PDE). The polyamine pattern predominantly contained homospermidine. Based on the data generated from the genotypic, phylogenetic, biochemical and chemotaxonomic analysis, it can be concluded that strain LNB2T is a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas for which the name Sphingomonas laterariae LNB2T is proposed. The type strain is LNB2T (=MTCC 10873T=CCM 7880T=DSM 25432T).
