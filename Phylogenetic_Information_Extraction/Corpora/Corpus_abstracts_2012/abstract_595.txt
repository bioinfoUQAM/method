An aerobic, alkane-oxidizing bacterium, designated strain EPR92T, was isolated from the hydrothermal fluids of a deep-sea vent on the East Pacific Rise at 9' 50' N, 104' 17' W. The cells were Gram-negative rods approximately 1.4 Em in length and 0.4 Em in width. Strain EPR92T grew between 20 ' and 40 'C (optimum 35 'C), 10 and 50 g 1(-1) NaCl (optimum 25 g 1(-1)) and pH 4.0 and pH 8.5 (optimum pH 7.5). The generation time under optimal conditions was 63 min. Strain EPR92T grew aerobically in Artificial Seawater Minimal Medium with n-alkanes as sole carbon and energy sources, and in Artificial Seawater medium supplemented with peptone and yeast extract. The predominant fatty acids were C18:1w7c, C19:0 cyclo w8c, 11-methyl C18:1w7c and a putative aldehyde C12:0. The major polar lipids were phospatidylglycerol, diphospatidylglycerol, phospatidylethanolamine, phospatidylicholine, and four unidentified aminolipids. Q10 was the major respiratory quinone. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 60.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene showed that strain EPR92T belongs to the Alpha subdivision of the Proteobacteria and that its closest species whose name was validly published were Parvibaculum indicum and Parvibaculum lavamentivorans (98.7 and 95.8 % sequence identity to strain EPR92T, respectively). DNA-DNA similarity between strain EPR92T and P. indicum was 47.7 %, indicating that the two strains do not belong to the same species. On the basis of phylogenetic, physiological, chemotaxonomic and genetic considerations, it is proposed that the organism represents a novel species within the genus Parvibaculum, for which the name Parvibaculum hydrocarboniclasticum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EPR92T (=DSM 23209T=JCM 16666T).
