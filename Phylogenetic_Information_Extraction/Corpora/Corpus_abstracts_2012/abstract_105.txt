A trypanosomatid species, designated as Typing Unit 1 (TU1) by sequences of SL RNA gene repeats, has been found in the intestine of pyrrhocorids (Insecta: Heteroptera) in Europe, Mediterranean, Central America and some parts of Asia and Africa. Phylogenetic analysis of the SL repeat sequences has shown that the isolates group in the tree according to their geographic origin. The maximal sequence divergence was observed in parasites from Neotropics suggesting the origin within and subsequent migrations from this region. The global distribution of the parasite could have been facilitated by ubiquity of its hosts that include several genera of the family Pyrrhocoridae. In Europe the TU1 flagellates frequently occur in Pyrrhocoris apterus, the host of Leptomonas pyrrhocorisZotta, 1912, a species that had been insufficiently defined by host and light microscopy level morphology. Herein, the Zotta's species description has been amended to include the TU1 SL RNA repeat, SSU rRNA, glycosomal GAPDH gene sequences, as well as ultrastructure. In addition, Leptomonas scantii n. sp. with an overlapping host range has been described. Moreover, 10 typing units of trypanosomatids found in the pyrrhocorid hosts demonstrate the extent of variability of trypanosomatids occurring in one host family.
