The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of different types of Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) in cattle skin lesions and to identify new viral types in Brazil. A total of 72 skin lesions were analysed from 66 different bovines by PCR using degenerate and specific primers, and subsequent sequencing. Sequencing quality was determined using Staden package with Phred 30. Similarity analysis was performed with BioEdit and BLAST programs to verify the identity with known BPV types. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using Maximum Likelihood method with TIM3_+_G as nucleotide substitution model in PAUP*, and 1000 non-parametric bootstrap replicates. Analyses revealed the presence of ten different types of BPV in the samples, with the exception of BPV7. The presence of co-infections was very high as almost all samples (89%) were co-infected. A putative new BPV11 subtype was also found in lesions from different animals. These results add significant knowledge about the prevalence and diversity of BPV infection in Brazilian cattle, which could be used in future studies aiming at the development of more specific treatment and diagnostic methods.
