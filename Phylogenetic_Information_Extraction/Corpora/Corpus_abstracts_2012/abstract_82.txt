The diversity of 71 rhizobial strains belonging to the genus Ensifer, isolated from root nodules of woody legumes growing in southern Ethiopia, was studied using Multilocus sequence analyses (MLSA) and phenotypic approaches. Phylogenetic analyses based on core genes revealed that 43 strains were clustered on seven distinct and consistent positions (genospecies I-VII), while 25 other strains were also distinct but discrepant in their placement on the different gene trees. The remaining three strains occupied the same phylogenetic branches as the defined Ensifer species and were thus not distinct. Irrespective of their chromosomal background, the majority of the test strains were highly related with respect to their nifH and nodC gene sequences, suggesting that these symbionts might recently have acquired these genes from a common origin. On the nifH phylogenetic tree, the branch containing the test strains and the reference species isolated from woody legumes in Africa, clearly separated from those outside the continent, suggesting that these symbionts have a long history of separate evolution within Ensifer for this gene. A cross-inoculation study showed that our strains were capable of eliciting effective nodulation on the homologous host and on other host species. This suggests a potential to improve N fixation by selecting for broad-host-range inoculants. Our study confirms the presence of a high diversity of Ensifer in Eastern Africa and, while contributing to the general knowledge of the biodiversity within the genus, also highlights the need to focus on previously less explored bio-geographical regions to unravel as yet unidentified rhizobial resources.
