Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is associated with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) in all age groups. However, there is limited information of genetic analysis of hMPV circulating in Beijing. To learn the characteristics of structural protein genes of human metapneumovirus circulating in children in Beijing, sequence analysis of matrix (M), small hydrophobic (SH) and attachment (G) proteins of hMPV from 2006 to 2010 was performed. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of 42 full length M genes, 49 SH gene and 55 G gene revealed that the hMPVs from pediatric patients were divided into sub-genotypes A2, B1 and B. There were highly conserved identities among M gene, with 7 conserved mutations of amino acids between A and B genotypes which were fairly conserved in the same genotype A or B. The amino acid identities of SH were 60.7% to 64.4% between different genotypes, 93.3% - 100% among same sub-genotype and 84.7% - 88.7% between different sub-genotypes. Use of alternative transcription-termination codon, nucleotide deletion and insertion resulted in variable length of nucleotide and deduced amino acid of G protein. Amino acid identities within same genotype ranged from 81.5% - 100%, whereas sequence identities between two genotypes ranged from 34.0% - 38.6% at the amino acid level. A new cluster of G genes in sub-genotype B2 appeared due to the same mutations and insertion of two amino acids in G protein encoding genes amplified from specimens collected from 2008 to 2010. Prediction of antigen sites of SH and G protein indicated that the variation of antigen sites between different sub-genotypes existed.
