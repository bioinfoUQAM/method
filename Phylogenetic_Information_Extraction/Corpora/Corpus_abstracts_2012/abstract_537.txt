"The alphaproteobacterial strain JLT2003(T) was isolated from surface seawater off the coast of Guishan island, Taiwan. The strain was Gram negative, ovoid or coccoid, non-motile and formed pink colonies on marine agar 2216 (MA; DIFCO) medium. The dominant fatty acids were C(18:1)_7c, cyclo C(19:0)_8c, and C(16:0). The polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol. The major respiratory ubiquinone was Q-10. The DNA G+C content was 62.3'mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the strain was most closely related to Pontibaca methylaminivorans GRP21(T) with 94.8% similarity. The isolate was distinguishable from members of the family Rhodobacteraceae based on phenotypic and biochemical characteristics. On the basis of the taxonomic data presented, strain JLT2003(T) is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Oceaniovalibus guishaninsula gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Oceaniovalibus guishaninsula is JLT2003(T) (=JCM 17765(T)'='CGMCC 1.10827(T))."
