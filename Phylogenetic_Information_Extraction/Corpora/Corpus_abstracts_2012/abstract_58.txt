THE NEWLY DISCOVERED SPECIES APPEAR TO BE RESTRICTED TO SINGLE, MOSTLY KARSTIC, LOCALITIES IN EXTREME NORTHERN MADAGASCAR: Brookesia confidens sp. n. from Ankarana, B. desperata sp. n. from Forat d'Ambre, B. micra sp. n. from the islet Nosy Hara, and B. tristis sp. n. from Montagne des Franaais. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes of all nominal species in the B. minima group congruently support that the four new species, together with B. tuberculata from Montagne d'Ambre in northern Madagascar, form a strongly supported clade. This suggests that these species have diversified in geographical proximity in this small area. All species of the B. minima group, including the four newly described ones, are characterized by very deep genetic divergences of 18-32% in the ND2 gene and >6% in the 16S rRNA gene. Despite superficial similarities among all species of this group, their status as separate evolutionary lineages is also supported by moderate to strong differences in external morphology, and by clear differences in hemipenis structure.
