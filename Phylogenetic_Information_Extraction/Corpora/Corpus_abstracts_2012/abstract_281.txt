Trypsin-like serine proteases are involved in large number of processes, especially in digestive degradation and immune responses. Here, we identify the characterization of a trypsin-like serine protease in planarian, Djtry, which interestingly has the incompletely conserved catalytic triad (K, D, and S). Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Djtry is an ancient type of trypsin-like serine proteases. The spatial and temporal expression patterns of Djtry are shown during regenerating and embryonic development by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Djtry is found to display a tissue specific expression pattern, with a predominant expression detected in whole gut region of intact and regenerating planarian. While the tissue- and stage-specific expression patterns during the embryonic development imply the roles of Djtry involve in yolk degradation and gut formation. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out to analyze the function of this protease in vivo after planarians were stimulated to a bacterial challenge and food. The results showed that Djtry increased after a bacterial challenge and was basically stable for food. Therefore, the trypsin-like serine protease might be involved in the innate defense reactions against bacterial infection.
