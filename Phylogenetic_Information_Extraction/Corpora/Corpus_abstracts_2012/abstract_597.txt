Strain Y4T, a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, aerobic and non-motile bacterium was isolated from Pinggu District, east Beijing in People's Republic of China. Polyphasic approach was used to determine the precise taxonomic position of strain Y4T. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain Y4T is most closely related to Luteimonas aquatic RIB1-20T (96.7%). DNA-DNA relatedness between strain Y4T and strain L. aquatic RIB1-20T is 42.5O3.9%. The predominant fatty acids are iso-C15:0, iso-C17:1_9c and iso-C16:0. Q-8 is the major ubiquinone. The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 69.9 mol%. Based on the evidence above, strain Y4T represents a novel species within the genus Luteimonas, for which the name L. cucumeris sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Y4T (=CGMCC 1.10821T=KCTC 23627T).
