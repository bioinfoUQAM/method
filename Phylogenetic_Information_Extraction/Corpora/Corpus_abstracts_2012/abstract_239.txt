The proteasome subunit beta type-8 (PSMB8) gene encodes a catalytic subunit of the immunoproteasome, which is involved in the generation of peptides presented by MHC class I molecules. To date, highly diverged dichotomous alleles of PSMB8 have been reported in Oryzias species (actinopterygian teleosts) and Xenopus species (sarcopterygian amphibians). These dimorphic alleles share a similar substitution (A/V(31)F/Y) at the 31st position of the mature protein, which is most probably involved in formation of the S1 pocket. This substitution likely confers different cleavage specificities on the dimorphic PSMB8s. In addition, two paralogous PSMB8 genes possessing the A and F residues at the 31st position have been reported in sharks. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the two types of PSMB8 of Oryzias, Xenopus, and sharks arose by independent evolutionary events. Here, we identified another pair of dimorphic alleles of PSMB8, which have the A and F residues at the 31st position of the mature protein, from bichir, Polypterus senegalus, a basal actinopterygian. The sequences of the mature proteins-encoding region of the dimorphic alleles of bichir PSMB8, the A and F types, showed only 72.7% and 77.5% identities at the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid levels, respectively. Their intronic sequences show almost no similarity, indicating that the dimorphic alleles of bichir PSMB8 have a very ancient origin. However, phylogenetic analysis showed that the dimorphisms of PSMB8 of bichir, Xenopus, and Oryzias arose by independent evolutionary events, suggesting the presence of a strong selective pressure for possessing the dimorphism.
