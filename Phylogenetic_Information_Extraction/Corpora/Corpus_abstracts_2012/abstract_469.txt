In our previous studies, five serine proteases containing clip domain were characterized from the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus. To further investigate the characterization and function of serine proteases, one serine protease (PtSP) and one serine protease homolog (PtSPH1) without clip domain were identified from haemocytes cDNA library in this paper. They both possessed an SP or SP-like domain at the C-terminal. In contrast to PtSP, absence of Ser catalytic residue resulted in the loss of serine protease activity of PtSPH1. Phylogenetic analysis suggested either SPs or SPHs might not have a single origin in gene evolution. Six introns presented in PtSP genomic DNA with one uncommon splice site (GG) was discovered at exon 1/intron 1 boundary region. Four introns with common splice sites were found in PtSPH1 genomic DNA. RT-PCR results showed that PtSP mRNA was mainly distributed in haemocytes, gill and eyestalk, whereas PtSPH1 transcript was mainly expressed in stomach. PtSP showed slight increase during the first 48'h compared to control groups except 8'h point after Micrococcus luteus challenge. However, significant up-regulation was observed in the expression level of PtSPH1 challenged by Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio alginolyticus, Gram-positive bacteria M.'luteus and fungi Pichia pastoris during the first 48'h. It indicates that PtSPH1 might be more sensitive to microorganism challenges compared with PtSP.
