"Psychrotolerant sporeforming bacteria represent a major challenge to the goal of extending the shelf-life of pasteurized dairy products. The objective of this study was to identify prominent phylogenetic groups of dairy-associated aerobic sporeformers and characterize representative isolates for phenotypes relevant to growth in milk. Analysis of sequence data for a 632 nt fragment of rpoB showed that 1,288 dairy associated isolates (obtained from raw and pasteurized milk, and dairy farm environments), grouped into two major divisions representing (i) the genus Paenibacillus (737 isolates including the species P. odorifer, P. graminis, and P. amylolyticus s.l.) and (ii) a division that includes Bacillus (n = 467; e.g., B. licheniformis s.l., B. pumilus, B. weihenstephanensis) and genera formerly classified as Bacillus (n = 84; e.g., Viridibacillus spp.). When isolates representing the most common rpoB allelic types (AT) were tested for growth in skim milk broth at 6'C, 7/9 Paenibacillus isolates, but only 2/9 isolates representing Bacillus subtypes grew to > 4 log(CFU/ml). In addition, 38/40 Paenibacillus isolates, but only 3/47 Bacillus isolates tested, were positive for _-galactosidase activity (including some isolates representing B. licheniformis s.l., a common dairy associated clade). Our study confirms that Paenibacillus spp. are the predominant psychrotolerant sporeformers in fluid milk and provides 16S rDNA and rpoB subtype data and phenotypic characteristics facilitating identification of aerobic sporeforming spoilage organisms of concern. These data will be critical for the development of detection methods and control strategies that will reduce the introduction of psychrotolerant sporeformers and extend the shelf-life of dairy products."
