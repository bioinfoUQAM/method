_ Premise of the study: In comparison to the wide use of chloroplast markers, few mitochondrial markers are available for phylogenetic studies in bryophytes. We investigated the phylogenetic suitability of several mtDNA markers within the Funariaceae and across mosses. _ Methods and Results: By comparing mitochondrial genomes of two mosses, eight regions with higher substitution rates were identified and sequenced for three species in the Funariaceae and one outgroup taxon. Variations in the substitution rate of these new loci were compared to previously used markers. Thirty-four samples representing all major moss lineages were targeted to assess the universality of the newly designed primers. _ Conclusions: The new markers provided similar or more sequence variations in Funariaceae compared to previously developed mtDNA markers. Five out of eight loci were amplified in 70% of other taxa, indicating that these markers may be suitable for phylogenetic studies in other moss lineages.
