An actinomycete strain K09-0627(T) was isolated from the roots of a variety of orchid collected in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Two actinomycete strains K11-0047(T) and K11-0057(T) were isolated from the roots of Rumex acetosa and Houttuynia cordata collected in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses indicated that the isolates belonged to the genus Phytohabitans and that they were closely related to each other and to Phytohabitans suffuscus K07-0523(T). The DNA-DNA hybridization relatedness values between the three isolates and P. suffuscus were below 70%. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization relatedness and phenotypic characteristics, the strains should be classified as new species in the genus Phytohabitans, for which the names Phytohabitans flavus sp. nov. (type strain, K09-0627(T) =JCM 17387(T) =NBRC 107702(T) =DSM 45551(T)), Phytohabitans rumicis sp. nov. (type strain, K11-0047(T) =JCM 17829(T) =NBRC 108638(T) =BCC 48146(T)) and Phytohabitans houttuyneae sp. nov. (type strain, K11-0057(T) =JCM 17830(T) =NBRC 108639(T) =BCC 48147(T)) are proposed.
