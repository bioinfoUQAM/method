The bacterial genus Listeria contains both saprotrophic and facultative pathogenic species. A small genome size has been suggested to be associated with the loss of pathogenic potential of L. welshimeri and L. seeligeri. In this paper we present data on the genome of L. monocytogenes strain FSL J1-208, a representative of phylogenetic lineage IV. Although this strain was isolated from a clinical case in a caprine host and has no decreased invasiveness in human intestinal epithelial cells, our analyses show that this strain has one of the smallest Listeria chromosomes reported to date (2.78 Mb). The chromosome contains 2772 protein coding genes, including well-characterized virulence associated genes such as inlA, inlB and inlC and the full prfA gene cluster. The small genome size is mainly caused by the absence of prophages in the genome of L. monocytogenes FSL J1-208, and further analyses show that the total size of prophage-related regions is highly correlated to chromosome size in the genus Listeria. L. monocytogenes FSL J1-208 carries a unique type of plasmid of approximately 80 Kbp, which does not carry genes annotated as being involved in resistance to antibiotics or heavy metals. The accessory genes in this plasmid belong to the internalin family, a family of virulence-associated proteins, and therefore this is the first report of a potential virulence plasmid in the genus Listeria.
