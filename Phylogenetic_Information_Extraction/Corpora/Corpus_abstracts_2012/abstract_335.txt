"The sequencing of 16S rRNA gene nucleotide chain of the 12 ""P. xanthochlora"" strains, collection Pseudomonas marginalis 8572 strain and Pseudomonas marginalis pv. marginalis 9175T P. fluorescens B-17T typical strains has been determined. The analysis of the 16S rRNA gene nucleotide chain showed high level of homology (98-99%) of ""P. xanthochlora"" investigated strains with the same of representatives of both P. fluorescens and P. marginalis species."
