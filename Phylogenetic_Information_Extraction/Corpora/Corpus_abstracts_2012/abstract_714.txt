Integrative and Conjugative Elements (ICEs) are self-mobile genetic elements found in the genomes of some bacteria. These elements may confer a fitness advantage upon their host bacteria through the cargo genes they carry. Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 7 (SPI-7), found within some pathogenic strains of Salmonella enterica, possesses features indicative of an ICE, and carries genes implicated in virulence. We aimed to identify and fully analyse ICEs related to SPI-7 within the genus Salmonella, and other Enterobacteriaceae. We report the sequence of two novel SPI-7-like elements, found within strains of Salmonella bongori, which share 97% nucleotide identity over conserved regions with SPI-7 and with each other. Although SPI-7 within Salmonella Typhi appears to be fixed within the chromosome, we present evidence that these novel elements are capable of excision and self-mobility. Phylogenetic analyses show that these Salmonella mobile elements share a common ancestor which existed approximately 3.6-15.8 million years ago. Additionally, we identified more distantly related ICEs, with distinct cargo regions, within other strains of Salmonella as well as within Citrobacter, Erwinia, Escherichia, Photorhabdus and Yersinia species. In total we report on a collection of 17 SPI-7 related ICEs within enterobacterial species, of which six are novel. Using comparative and mutational studies, we have defined a core of 27 genes essential for conjugation. We present a growing family of SPI-7 related ICEs whose mobility, abundance and cargo variability indicate that these elements may have had a large impact on the evolution of the Enterobacteriaceae.
