The Smad proteins are essential components of the TGF-_/activin/nodal family signaling pathway. We report the identification and expression of transcripts representing three receptor Smads (Smad2a, Smad2b, and Smad3), two common Smads (Smad4a and Smad4b), and one inhibitory Smad (Smad7). Phylogenetic analysis suggests this gene family evolved through the combination of ancient and more recent salmonid genome duplication events. Tissue distribution, embryonic expression, and expression in growth hormone (GH) treated fish were assessed by reverse transcription PCR or qPCR. All six Smad transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues. We observed the highest expression of the receptor Smads in unfertilized eggs, generally decreasing during early embryonic development and slightly increasing around 11'days post-fertilization (dpf). Smad7 expression was low for most of embryonic development, with a dramatic increase at the onset of muscle development (6 dpf), and at hatch (24 dpf). Smad4 expression was low during early embryonic development and increased after 14 dpf. The increased expression of Smad4 and Smad7 during late embryonic development may indicate modulation of gene expression by GH axis, which initiates activity during late embryonic development. These data were supported by the modulation of these Smads in the gill filament, stomach, and muscle following a GH treatment. Additionally, these changes are concurrent with the modulation of expression of TGF-_ family members. Most significantly, the increased expression of Smad7 in the muscle is simultaneous with increased expression of MSTN1A and not MSTN1B during both embryonic development and following GH treatment. These data indicate a promyogenic role for Smad7 as previously identified in other non-fish species.
