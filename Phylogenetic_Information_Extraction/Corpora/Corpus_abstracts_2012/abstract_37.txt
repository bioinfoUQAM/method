"Raspberry latent virus (RpLV) is a newly characterized reovirus found in commercial raspberry fields in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Thus far, all members of the plant reoviruses are transmitted in a replicative persistent manner by several species of leafhoppers or planthoppers. After several failed attempts to transmit RpLV using leafhoppers, the large raspberry aphid commonly found in the PNW, was tested as a vector of the virus. The virus was transmitted to new healthy raspberry plants when inoculated with groups of at least 50 viruliferous aphids, suggesting that aphids are vectors of RpLV, albeit inefficient. Using absolute and relative quantification methods, it was shown that the virus titer in aphids continued to increase after the acquisition period even when aphids were serially transferred onto fresh healthy plants on a daily basis. Transmission experiments determined that RpLV has a 6-day latent period in the aphid before it becomes transmissible; however, it was not transmitted transovarially to the next generation. To our knowledge this is the first report of a plant reovirus transmitted by an aphid. Phylogenetic analyses showed that RpLV is related most closely to but distinct from Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV), the type member of the genus Oryzavirus. Moreover, the conserved nucleotide termini of the genomic segments of RpLV did not match those of RRSV or other plant reoviruses, allowing to suggest that RpLV is probably the type member of a new genus in the Reoviridae comprising aphid-transmitted reoviruses."
