"A common observation in the vertebrate testis is that new germ cell clones enter spermatogenesis proper before previously formed clones have completed their development. The extent to which the developmental advance of any given germ cell clone in any phase of spermatogenesis is dependent on that of neighboring clones and/or on the coordinating influence of associated Sertoli cells in the immediate vicinity or of others further away remains unclear. This review presents an overall synthesis of findings in an ancient vertebrate, the spiny dogfish shark and shows that, even at this phyletic level, the developmental advance of a given germ cell clone is the outcome of various processes emanating from its spatiotemporal relationship with (1) its own complement of Sertoli cells in the anatomically distinct spermatocyst and (2) Sertoli cells associated with other germ cell clones that lie upstream or downstream in the spermatogenic progression and that secrete, among others, androgen and estrogen destined for target sites upstream. Analysis of the protracted spermatogenic cycle shows the coordination in space and time of spermatogenic and steroidogenic events. Furthermore, the natural withdrawal of pituitary gonadotropin support in the dogfish causes a distinct and highly ordered gradient of apoptosis among the spermatogonial generations; this in turn is a major contributing factor to the cyclic nature of sperm production observed in this lower vertebrate. Because of the simplicity of their testicular organization, their cystic spermatogenesis and their phylogenetic position, cartilaginous fishes constitute a valid vertebrate reference system for comparative analysis with higher vertebrates."
