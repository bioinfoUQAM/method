Two isolates of intra-amoeba-growing bacteria, LegAT and LegMT, were characterized on the basis of microscopic appearance, staining characteristics, axenic growth at different temperatures and the sequences of the mip, rpoB, 16S rRNA, and rnpb genes as well as the 23S-5S region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these two isolates lay within the radius of the Legionellaceae. Furthermore, the analysis of these genes yielded congruent data that indicated that, although LegMT clusters specifically with L. feeleii and LegAT clusters with L. nautarum, the divergence observed between these species was greater than that observed between other members of the family. Taken together, these results support the proposal of these two isolates as new Legionella species, which we propose be named Legionella tunisiensis sp. nov. (for LegMT) and Legionella massiliensis sp. nov. (for LegAT).
