Direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) and nested PCR were employed to detect the monitoring samples including brain tissues of dogs and saliva, serum or urine which were collected in 2008 to 2009, from the rabies patients. Positive samples were sequenced by ABI3730 gene analyzer for the full length of the N gene target. The homology and hpylogeography of the rabies virus were analyzed after the phylogenetic tree was constructed by Blast, Clustal W and Mega 4.0 software.
