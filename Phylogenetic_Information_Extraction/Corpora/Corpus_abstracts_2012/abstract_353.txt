A Gram-stain-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated CAU 1074T, was isolated from a marine sediment and its taxonomic position was investigated using a polyphasic approach. Strain CAU 1074T grew optimally at 30'C and pH 6.5. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain CAU 1074T formed a distinct lineage within the genus Haloferula and was the most closely related to Haloferula harenae KCTC 22198T (96.0% similarity). Strain CAU 1074T contained MK-9 as the major isoprenoid quinone, and iso-C14:0, C16:1 w9c, zand C16:0 as the major fatty acids. The cell wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The major whole-cell sugars were glucose, xylose, mannose, and ribose. The polar lipids were composed of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, aminoglycolipid, and two unidentified phospholipids. The DNA G+C content of the strain was 64.0 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic-, chemotaxonomic data and phylogenetic inference, strain CAU 1074T (KCTC=23578T, CCUG=61920T) should be classified into genus Haloferula, as a member of a novel species, for which the name Haloferula chungangensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CAU 1074T.
