Higher-order RNA structures in the 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), separate species in the betacoronavirus genus, appear largely conserved despite a _36% nt sequence divergence. In a previous study, each of three 5'-proximal cis-acting stem-loop domains in the BCoV genome, I/II, III, and IV, yielded near wt-like MHV phenotypes when used by reverse genetics to replace its counterpart in the MHV genome. Replacement with the BCoV 32-nt inter-stem-loop fourth domain between stem-loops III and IV, however, required blind cell passaging for virus recovery. Here, we describe suppressor mutations within the transplanted BCoV 32-nt domain that along with appearance of potential base-pairings identify an RNA-RNA interaction between this domain and a 32-nt region _200-nt downstream within the nsp1 coding region. Mfold and phylogenetic covariation patterns among similarly-grouped betacoronaviruses support this interaction as does co-transplantation of the BCoV 5' UTR and its downstream base-pairing domain. Interestingly, co-transplantation of the BCoV 5' UTR and BCoV nsp1 coding region directly yielded an MHV wt-like phenotype which demonstrates a cognate interaction between these two BCoV regions that in the MHV genome act in a fully inter-species-compliant manner. Surprisingly, the 30-nt inter-stem-loop domain in the MHV genome can be deleted and viral progeny, although debilitated, are still produced. These results together identify a previously undescribed long-range RNA-RNA interaction between the 5' UTR and nsp1 coding region in MHV-like and BCoV-like betacoronaviruses that is cis-acting for viral fitness but is not absolutely required for viral replication in cell culture.
