"More than 150 Ma, the avian lineage separated from that of other dinosaurs and later diversified into the more than 10,000 species extant today. The early neoavian bird radiations most likely occurred in the late Cretaceous (more than 65 Ma) but left behind few if any molecular signals of their archaic evolutionary past. Retroposed elements, once established in an ancestral population, are highly valuable, virtually homoplasy-free markers of species evolution; after applying stringent orthology criteria, their phylogenetically informative presence/absence patterns are free of random noise and independent of evolutionary rate or nucleotide composition effects. We screened for early neoavian orthologous retroposon insertions and identified six markers with conflicting presence/absence patterns, whereas six additional retroposons established before or after the presumed major neoavian radiation show consistent phylogenetic patterns. The exceptionally frequent conflicting retroposon presence/absence patterns of neoavian orders are strong indicators of an extensive incomplete lineage sorting era, potentially induced by an early rapid successive speciation of ancestral Neoaves."
