Five strains of a previously unknown anamorphic, methanol-assimilating yeast species are described for which the name Candida borneonana is proposed. The strains were isolated from fruit waste collected in markets in Brunei (Borneo). The sequences of the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit rRNA genes, the ITS (internal transcribed spacer) regions and the 18S rRNA genes were identical in the isolates and differed from the corresponding sequences of all known yeast species. In a phylogenetic analysis of these sequences, the new species formed a cluster with Kuraishia species (the closest species was K. capsulata with 6% nucleotide substitutions in the D1/D2 domain). The type strain is 11-487T. It has been deposited in Centralbureau voor Schimmelcultures (Utrecht, the Netherlands) as CBS 12507T, the Culture Collection of Yeasts (Bratislava, Slovakia) as CCY 29-182-1T and the National Collection of Agricultural and Industrial Microorganisms (Budapest, Hungary) as NCAM Y.02008. The GenBank accession numbers for nucleotide sequences of C. borneonana are JQ001938 (D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA gene) and JQ038035 (18S rRNA gene and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2). Mycobank: MB 563710.
