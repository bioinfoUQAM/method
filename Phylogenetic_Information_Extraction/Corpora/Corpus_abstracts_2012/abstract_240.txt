Recently, members of the genus Tsukamurella have been implicated as important etiologic pathogens contributing to bloodstream and pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients. Tsukamurella species share many features with other mycolic acid-containing genera of the order Actinomycetales and might therefore be misidentified as belonging to one of these genera. We developed a TaqMan-based real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for the rapid and specific detection of infections due to Tsukamurella species. The assay amplifies and detects a 157-bp segment of the 16S rRNA gene of Tsukamurella. The specificity of the assay was confirmed using a panel of DNAs from 12 Tsukamurella strains and 11 strains belonging to 8 phylogenetic closely related genera. The sensitive and specific nature of the assay provides a valuable tool for the early and precise diagnosis of Tsukamurella infections in clinical diagnostic laboratories.
