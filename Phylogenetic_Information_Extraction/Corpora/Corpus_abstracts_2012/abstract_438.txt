Approximately 2500 fly species comprise the Sarcophagidae family worldwide. The complete mitochondrial genome of the carrion-breeding, forensically important Sarcophaga impatiens Walker (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) from Australia was sequenced. The 15,169'bp circular genome contains the 37 genes found in a typical Metazoan genome: 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and 22 transfer RNA genes. It also contains one non-coding A+T-rich region. The arrangement of the genes was the same as that found in the ancestral insect. All the protein initiation codons are ATN, except for cox1 that begins with TCG (encoding S). The 22 tRNA anticodons of S. impatiens are consistent with those observed in Drosophila yakuba, and all form the typical cloverleaf structure, except for tRNA-Ser((AGN)) that lacks the DHU arm. The mitochondrial genome of Sarcophaga presented will be valuable for resolving phylogenetic relationships within the family Sarcophagidae and the order Diptera, and could be used to identify favourable genetic markers for species identifications for forensic purposes.
