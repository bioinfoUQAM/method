Four Gram-positive, aerobic strains isolated from a pharmaceutical clean room (strain WS4616T), a dessert milk product (strain WS4617) and from raw milk (strains WS4623 and WS4624) were characterized using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA and recA gene sequences showed that they form a distinct lineage within the family Propionibacteriaceae. Similarity values between 16S rRNA gene sequences of the four strains and the type species of all genera belonging to the family Propionibacteriaceae were 90.3-94.1%. The major cellular fatty acid was anteiso-C15:0 and no respiratory quinone could be detected. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of type A3_contained LL-diaminopimelic acid (DAP), alanine, glycine and glutamic acid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain WS4616T was 67.7 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic and genetic data, strains WS4616T, WS4617, WS4623 and WS4624 are classified as members of a new genus and a single novel species, Naumannia halotolerans gen. nov., sp. nov., within the family Propionibacteriaceae. The type strain of Naumannia halotolerans is WS4616T (DSM 24323T = LMG 26184T).
