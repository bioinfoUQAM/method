We determined for the first time the nearly complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the entozoic Polyascus gregaria, a representative of Rhizocephala, Cirripedia. The nearly complete mitogenome was 15, 465'bp in length, consisting of 11 protein-coding genes, two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes and one major incomplete noncoding region. In total there are 73 overlapping nucleotides and 17 spacers between genes. All genes sequenced in P. gregaria mtDNA (including RNAs) were encoded on the same strand of the DNA, and the gene arrangement differed from that of other metazoan animals. The mitochondrial genome rearrangements included translocation of at least 8 genes and even inversion of the coding polarity of at least 2 genes. Comparative analysis of the gene orders with other maxillopodan mtDNAs showed that the unique characteristics of the thoracican cirripeds lineage were not observed in this representative of rhizocephalan. Phylogenetic analyses supported a close affinity of Rhizocephala to Thoracica. By adding the mitochondrial genomes from 4 copepods, the reciprocally monophyletic cirripeds and copepods clustered as sister groups, refusing the close relationship between Cirripedia and Remipedia. However, the monophyly of Maxillopoda was not supported in this study.
