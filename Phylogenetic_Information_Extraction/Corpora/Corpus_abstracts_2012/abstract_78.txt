"Two Gram-positive, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacteria (strains RHLT1-17T and RHLT2-1T) were isolated from Hailuogou glacier in Szechwan province, P. R. China. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the strains belonged to the genus Nocardioides and shared 97.8 % sequence similarity to each other. The highest level of sequence similarity (97.6_%, 98.4 %, respectively) were found with Nocardioides kribbensis. Strain RHLT1-17T grow at 0-35'C and strain RHLT2-1T grow at 0-25'C. The major cellular fatty acids of strain RHLT1-17T were C17:1_8c (32.69 %) and iso-C16:0 (21.74 %). The major cellular fatty acids of strain RHLT2-1T were C18:1 _9c (28.72%), summed feature 3 (17.14 %; comprising C16:1_7c and/or C16:1_6c), iso-C16:0 (14.35 %), C16:0 (9.96 %) and iso-C14:0 (8.34 %). Both strains contained LL-2, 6-diaminopimelic acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan, MK-8(H4) as the predominant menaquinone. On the basis of a polyphasic approach, two novel species Nocardioides szechwanensis sp. nov. (type strain = RHLT1-17T =CGMCC 1.11147T =NBRC 108562T) and Nocardioides psychrotolerans sp. nov. (type strain = RHLT2-1T =CGMCC 1.11156T =NBRC 108563T) are proposed."
