Mycobacterial plasmid pAL5000 represents a family of plasmids found mostly in Actinobacteria. It replicates using two plasmid encoded proteins RepA and RepB. While BLAST searches indicate that RepA is a Replicase family protein, the evolutionary connection of RepB cannot be established as no significant homologous partner (E < 10(-3)) outside the RepB family can be identified. To obtain insight into the structure-function and evolutionary connections of RepB, an investigation was undertaken using homology modeling, phylogenetic and mutational analysis methods. The results indicate that although synthesized from the same operon phylogenetic affinities of RepA and RepB differ. The operon thus may have evolved through random breaking and joining events. Homology modeling predicted the presence of a three-helical Helix-Turn-Helix domain characteristic of the region 4 of Extra Cytoplasmic Function (ECF) _ factors, in the C-teminal region of RepB. At the N terminal region there is a helical stretch, which may be distantly related to region 3 of _ factors. Mutational analysis identified two arginines indispensible for RepB activity, one each located within the C and N terminal conserved regions respectively. Apart from analyzing the domain organization of the protein, the significance of the presence of a highly conserved A/T rich element, within the RepB binding site, was investigated. Mutational analysis revealed, that although this motif does not bind RepB, its integrity is important for efficient DNA-protein interaction and replication to occur. The present investigation unravels the possibility that RepB like proteins and their binding sites represent ancient DNA-protein interaction modules.
