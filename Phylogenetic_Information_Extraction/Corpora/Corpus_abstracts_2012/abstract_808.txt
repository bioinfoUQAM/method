"Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that 599 of them belonged to 101 species of 34 genera, and 4 isolates with < 97% sequence similarities to their closely related members were presumed to be potential novel species. Bacillus is the most dominant genus with 315 strains; Streptomyces, Staphylococcus and Lysinibacillus were dominant genera, with 121, 45 and 35 strains, respectively. The number of isolates belong to the other 31 genera were less than 10 strains, furthermore, only one strain was detected in 16 genera."
