Strain R46T, a marine Alphaproteobacterium, was isolated from Mediterranean seawater at Malvarrosa beach, Valencia, Spain. It is an aerobic chemoorganotroph, mesophilic and slightly halophilic organism, with complex ionic requirements. The phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequences showed that strain R46T forms a separate branch within the family Rhodobacteraceae, bearing similarities below 94.7% and 80.3%, respectively, to any other stablished species. It contains Q10 as the predominant isoprenoid quinone and C18:1 _7c / C18:1 _6c as the major cellular fatty acid. Phosphatidyl glycerol is the only identified polar lipid, although other lipids are also detected. The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 61.3 mol%. On the basis of extensive phenotypic and phylogenetic comparative analysis, it is concluded that the strain represents a novel genus and species, for which the name Actibacterium mucosum gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain of Actibacterium mucosum is R46T (=CECT 7668T = KCTC 23349T).
