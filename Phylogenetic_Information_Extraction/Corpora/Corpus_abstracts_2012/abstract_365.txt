Phylogenetic comparison has been done among the selected heterocystous cyanobacteria belonging to the sections IV and V. The hierarchical cluster analysis based on antibiotics sensitivity showed a distant relationship between the members of Nostocales and Stigonematales. Thus, multiple antibiotic resistance pattern used as marker provide easy, fast, and reliable method for strain discrimination and genetic variability. However, morphological, physiological (both based on principal component analysis) and biochemical analysis grouped true branching cyanobacteria along with the members of section IV. Molecular analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that Hapalosiphon welwitschii and Westiellopsis sp. were grouped in cluster I whereas Scytonema bohnerii, a false branching genera showed a close proximity with Calothrix brevissima in cluster II. Cluster III of clade 2 included Nostoc calcicola and Anabaena oryzae which proved the heterogeneity at the generic level. Cluster IV the largest group of clade 2 based on 16S rRNA gene sequences includes six strains of the genera Nostoc, Anabaena, and Cylindrospermum showing ambiguous evolutionary relationship. In cluster IV, Anabaena sp. and Anabaena doliolum were phylogenetically linked by sharing 99% sequence similarity. Probably, they were of the same genetic makeup but appear differently under the diverse physiological conditions. Section IV showed polyphyletic origin whereas section V showed monophyletic origin. Results suggested that either morphological or physiological or biochemical or molecular attribute is not sufficient to provide true diversity and phylogeny of the cyanobacteria at the generic level and thus, a polyphasic approach would be more appropriate and reliable.
