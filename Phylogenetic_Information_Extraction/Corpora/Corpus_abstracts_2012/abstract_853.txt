A slightly halophilic, Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped, non-motile bacterial strain, designated TW15T, was isolated from the ark clam in South Korea. Growth occurred under conditions of 10-37 'C, 1-5 % (w/v) NaCl and pH 7.0-10.0. Optimal growth occurred at 25-30 'C, in the presence of 2 % (w/v) NaCl and at pH 8.0. Strain TW15T exhibited both oxidase and catalase activities. The major fatty acids of strain TW15T were summed features 8 (C18:1 _7c and/or C18:1 _6c), 11-methyl C18:1 _7c. The novel strain contained ubiquinone-10 (Q-10) as the predominant isoprenoide quinone. The polar lipids of strain TW15T comprised phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified phospholipid, an unidentified amino lipid and five unidentified lipids. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain TW15T is most closely related to Ruegeria lacuscaerulensis ITI-1157T, with 98.0 % similarity. DNA-DNA hybridization assays with related strains yielded values of less than 52O3 %. The DNA G+C content was 55.7 mol%. On the basis of polyphasic taxonomic study, strain TW15T appears to represent a novel species of the genus Ruegeria, for which the name Ruegeria conchae sp. nov. is proposed and for which the type strain is TW15T (= KACC 15115T = JCM 17315T).
