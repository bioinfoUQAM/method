Strain xyl-d was gram-negative, rod-shaped, spore-forming and strictly anaerobic. The growth temperature ranged from 30 degrees C to 85 degrees C (optimum 65 degrees C) and the pH ranged from 3.0 to 10.0 (optimum 7.5) and salt concentration was 0% - 4% (optimum at 2.0%). It converted D-xylose into ethanol, acetate, CO2, trace amount of iso-butanol and propionate. The genomic DNA G + C contents of strain xyl-d was 45.6 mol%. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, strain xyl-d was most close to Thermoanaerobacter wiegelii DSM10319(T) and Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus DSM 2246(T) both with the 99.3% similarity. It produced more ethanol and less acetate at initial pH 8.5 than other pH. Ethanol yield was increased significantly with yeast extract, and ethanol became the main end product. In addition, growth of strain xyl-d was inhibited obviously with ethanol concentration more than 7% (V/V). In the optimum growth conditions, xylose degradation rates reached to 91.37%.
