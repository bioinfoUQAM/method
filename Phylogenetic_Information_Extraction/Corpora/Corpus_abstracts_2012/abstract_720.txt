"Taxonomic position of a Gram-negative, non-motile, oxidase negative and catalase positive strain A648T, isolated from hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) dumpsite located in Lucknow, India was ascertained using a polyphasic approach. A comparative analysis of partial sequence of the rpoB gene and 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain A648T belongs to the genus Acinetobacter. DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain A648T and other closely related members namely Acinetobacter radioresistens DSM 6976T; Acinetobacter venetianus ATCC 31012T; Acinetobacter baumannii LMG 1041T; Acinetobacter parvus LMG 21765T; Acinetobacter junii LMG 998T and Acinetobacter soli JCM 15062T were found to be less than 8 %. The major cellular fatty acids of strain A648T were 18:1 _9c (19.6 %), summed feature 3 (15.9 %), 16:0 (10.6 %) and 12:0 (6.4 %). The DNA G+C content was 40.4 mol%. The polar lipid profile of strain A648T depicted the presence of diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), followed by phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC). The predominant polyamine of strain A648T was 1, 3-diaminopropane and moderate amounts of putrescine, spermidine and spermine were also detected. The respiratory quinone consists of ubiquinone with nine isoprene units (Q-9). On the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization, phenotypic characteristics, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis with closely related members of the genus Acinetobacter, strain A648T is found to be a novel species of the genus Acinetobacter for which the name Acinetobacter indicus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is A648T (= DSM 25388T = CCM 7832T)."
