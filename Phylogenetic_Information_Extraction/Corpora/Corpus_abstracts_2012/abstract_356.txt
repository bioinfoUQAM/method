A novel bacterial strain, YC7001(T), was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of rice collected at Jinju, Korea and was characterized using a polyphasic approach. Cells of strain YC7001(T) were Gram-negative, yellow-pigmented, rod-shaped, aerobic, heterotrophic and non-motile. Strain YC7001(T) grew optimally at 25-30 'C, pH 5.0-8.0 and degraded gelatin, cellulose and chitin. The phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain YC7001(T) belongs to the genus Chitinophaga in the family Chitinophagaceae. Most closely related species are Chitinophaga sancti NBRC 15057(T) (96.9 %), Chitinophaga ginsengisoli Gsoil 052(T) (95.9 %), Chitinophaga pinensis DSM 2588(T) (95.7 %), Chitinophaga filiformis IFO 15056(T) (95.7 %), and Chitinophaga niabensis JS13-10(T) (95.0 %). DNA-DNA relatedness value of strain YC7001(T) with C. sancti NBRC 15057(T) was 15.2O0.6 %. Strain YC7001(T) contained MK-7 as the major menaquinone and homospermidine as the major polyamine. The major fatty acids of strain YC7001(T) were C(15 : 0) iso, C(16 : 1)_5c and C(17 : 0) iso 3-OH. The polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, unknown aminolipids and unknown lipids. The total genomic DNA G+C content was 41.3 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, strain YC7001(T) represents a novel species of the genus Chitinophaga in the family Chitinophagaceae, for which the name Chitinophaga oryziterrae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YC7001(T) (= KACC 14533(T) = JCM 16595(T)).
