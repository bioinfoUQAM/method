Zhengzhou is the capital of Henan province, where severely HIV prevalence was found in former paid plasma donors. In recent years, HIV epidemic in men who have sex with men (MSM) increased rapidly in the city. To explore the subtype distribution and genetic characterization of HIV in MSM in Zhengzhou city, phylogenetic analysis was fulfilled basing on full-length gag, pol, and partial env gene. A total of 31 HIV-1 sero-positive MSM individuals were enrolled. Full length gag, pol and partial env gene were amplified and sequenced. Multiple subtypes, including CRF01_AE (45.2%), subtype B (38.7%) and CRF07_BC (16.1%), were identified. Close phylogenetic relationship among our strains with strains from Henan local area, Hebei MSM population, Beijing area and Liaoning area were found, suggesting multiple introduction of HIV into the population. The results will provide clue for prevention and behavior change in Henan MSM population and also detailed sequence data for vaccine design.
