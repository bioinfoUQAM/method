"A taxonomic study of strain M-07(T) isolated from nitrifying-denitrifying activated sludge treating piggery wastewater was performed. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence demonstrated that strain M-07(T) belonged to the genus Advenella. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between M-07(T) and Advenella incenata LMG 22250(T), Advenella mimigardefordensis LMG 22922(T), and Advenella kashmirensis LMG 22695(T) was 96.5, 97.3, and 96.9%, respectively. The DNA G + C content of strain M-07(T) was 49.5 mol%, which was approximately 5% lower than that of other Advenella species (53.5-58.0 mol%). The predominant cellular fatty acids of strain M-07(T) were C(16:0) (33.3%), summed feature 3 (comprising C(16:1)_7c and/or iso-C(15:0) 2-OH; 20.5%), C(17:0) cyclo (16.8%), summed feature 2 (comprising C(14:0) 3-OH and/or iso-C(16:1) I; 9.3%), and C(18:1)_7c (8.1%). The isoprenoid quinone of the strain was Q-8. On the basis of phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis, and DNA-DNA relatedness data, a novel species of Advenella, for which the name Advenella faeciporci sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is M-07(T) (= JCM 17746(T) = KCTC 23732(T))."
