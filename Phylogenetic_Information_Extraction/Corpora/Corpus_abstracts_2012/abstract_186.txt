N-acetylglucosamine is an essential part of the glyosyl chain in N-linked glycoproteins, it is a building block for polysaccharides such as chitin and several glucosaminoglycans and proteins can be O-GlcNAcylated. The deacetylated form, glucosamine, is integral part of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. Both are incorporated into polymers by glycosyltransferases that utilize UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. This UDP-sugar is synthesized in a short pathway comprising 4 steps starting from fructose-6-phosphate. Glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) N-acetyltransferase (GNA) catalyses the second of these four reactions in the de-novo synthesis in eukaryotes. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that only one GNA isoform can be found in most of the investigated species and that the most likely Arabidopsis candidate is encoded by the gene At5g15770 (AtGNA). qPCR revealed the ubiquitous expression of AtGNA in all organs of Arabidopsis plants. Heterologous expression of AtGNA showed that it is highly active at pH between 7 and 8 and at temperatures of 30-40'C. It showed Km values of 231EM for GlcN6P and 33EM for acetyl-CoA respectively and a catalytic efficiency comparable to that of other characterized GNA. The solved crystal structure of AtGNA at a resolution of 1.5e revealed a very high structural similarity to crystallized GNA proteins from Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cereviseae despite less well conserved protein sequence identity.
