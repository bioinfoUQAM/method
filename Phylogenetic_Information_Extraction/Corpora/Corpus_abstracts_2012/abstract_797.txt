To study the genetic characteristics and function of swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) class I from the Hebao pig, a rare inbreed in China, a pair of primers was designed to amplify the SLA-2 gene (SLA-2-HB) and then the genetic characteristics of the gene were analyzed. The 3D homology modeling was used to analyze the structure and function of SLA-2-HB proteins. After cloning, sequencing and computer analysis, four SLA-2-HB alleles were found, all of 1,119 bp. Sites 3-1,097 were an open reading frame encoding 364 amino acids with two sets of intra-chain disulfide bonds comprising four cysteines situated in sites 125, 188, 227 and 283. By alignment of SLA-2-HB sequences with other SLA-2 alleles in the IPD database, eleven key variable amino acid sites were found in the extracellular domain of the SLA-2-HB alleles at sites 23(F), 24(I), 43(A), 44(K), 50(Q), 73(N), 95(I), 114(R), 155(G), 156(E) and 216(S), which could be used to differentiate other SLA-2 alleles. The 3D homology modeling demonstrated that the 8 of 11 key variable amino acid sites were all in antigenic binding groove of SLA-2-HB proteins. The amino acid identities between SLA-2-HB and other SLA-2, SLA-1 and SLA-3 alleles were 86.2-97.0%, 85.0-93.9% and 83.3-88.6%, respectively. The phylogenetic tree of SLA-2-HB showed that it was relatively independent of the other SLA-2 genes. Furthermore, the SLA-2-HB alleles were similar to HLA-B15 and HLA-A2 functional domains and preserved some functional sites of HLA-A2. It was concluded that SLA-2-HB are novel alleles of SLA-2 and that the Hebao pig might have evolved independently in China.
