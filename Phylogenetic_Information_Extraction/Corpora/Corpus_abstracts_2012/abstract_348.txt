A novel antimicrobial and anticancer compound-producing actinomycete, strain PT708T was isolated from cave soil collected in Pha Tup Cave Forest Park, Nan province, Thailand. Chemotaxonomic properties of this strain were consisted with those of members of the genus Nonomuraea. The major menaquinone was MK-9(H4), with the minor amounts of MK-9(H6), MK-9(H2), MK-10(H2) and MK-8(H4). The polar lipid profile contained phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, hydroxyl-phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, hydroxyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositolmannoside and phosphatidylinositol. The major fatty acids were iso-16:0, 10-methyl 17:0, 16:0 and 17:1 _6c. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain PT708T belongs to the genus Nonomuraea and is most closely related to Nonomuraea rhizophila YIM 67092T (98.50%) and Nonomuraea rosea GW 12687T (98.30%). The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain PT708T and other members of this genus were lower than 98%. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain PT708T was 73.3 mol%. The distinctive morphology of this strain compared with that of other members in the genus Nonomuraea is the formation of single spores at the tips of aerial hyphae. Phenotypic and genotypic differences allowed the distinction of the strain from closely related species. Consequently, strain PT708T represents a novel species of the genus Nonomuraea, for which the name Nonomuraea monospora sp. nov. is proposed, with PT708T (=TISTR1910T =JCM16114T) as the type strain.
