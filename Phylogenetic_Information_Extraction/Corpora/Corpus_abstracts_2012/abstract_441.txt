The sera of 223 blood donors who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as determined by the ELISA method were selected. HBV DNA was extracted from the sera of 134 blood donors by a commercial kit, and the entire polymerase gene was amplified by nested-PCR. HBV genotypes were determined by direct sequencing of the HBV polymerase gene. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method.
