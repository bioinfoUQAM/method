Genome content analysis has been used as a source of phylogenetic information in large prokaryotic tree of life studies. Recently the sequencing of many eukaryotic genomes has allowed for the similar use of genome content analysis for these organisms too. In this communication we examine the utility of genome content analysis for recovering phylogenetic patterns in several eukaryotic groups. By constructing multiple matrices using different e value cutoffs we examine the dynamics of altering the e value cutoff on five eukaryotic genome data sets. Our analysis indicates that the e value cutoff that is used as a criterion in the construction of the genome content matrix is a critical factor in both the accuracy and information content of the analysis. Strikingly, genome content by itself is not a reliable or accurate source of characters for phylogenetic analysis of the taxa in the five data sets we analyzed. We discuss two problems - small genome attraction and genome duplications as being involved in the rather poor performance of genome content data in recovering eukaryotic phylogeny.
