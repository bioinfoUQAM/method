In total, 7 rubella strains were isolated from 52 clinical specimens, of which six were classified as genotype 1E and only one was characterized as genotype 2B. In the phylogenetic tree, the Zhejiang 1E genotype rubella strains were located in the same branches with Hongkong or Hainan isolates respectively, but the Zhejiang 2B genotype strain were located in the same branch with oversea strain BuenosAires. ARG/46.08. Through p-distance analysis, results also showed that the Zhejiang 2B genotype strain was closer to the 2B strains isolated from overseas (0.011) than those strains from other provinces of China (0.023). Compared with Chinese vaccine strain BRD II, the homology on three structural genes was C > E2 > E1, but the homology of deduced amino acid sequence was E1 > C > E2, with corresponding 3, 11 and 23 amino acid mutations. There was only one amino acid on E1 gene with entropy value higher than 0.600, but seven sites on E2 gene with entropy value appeared higher than 0.600 and one with entropy value higher than 1.000.
