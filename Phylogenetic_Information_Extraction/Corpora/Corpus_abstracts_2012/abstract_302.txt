The comparative analysis of the symbiotic genes nifD, nifH, nodA of wild-growing Lathyrus L. species (Fabaceae) connected by genes sequences of 16S aRNA to Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae, Rhizobium tropici, Agrobacterium sp., and Phyllobacterium sp. was carried out. It was demonstrated that all tested genes of strains taken for analysis had high degree of homology with analogous genes of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae. It was suggested that symbiotic genes were introduced into Rhizobium tropici, Agrobacterium sp., and Phyllobacterium sp. strains by means of horizontal gene transfer over from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae strain. The recombinant strains were formed, capable to nodulate Lathyrus L. species that earlier was not considered characteristic for these plants.
