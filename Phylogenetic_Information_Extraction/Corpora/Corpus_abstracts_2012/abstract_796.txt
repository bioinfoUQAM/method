A fragment (564 bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b (Cyt-b) gene was studied for 73 individual rice field frogs (Hoplobatrachus rugulosus) from 18 geographical locations (populations) within Thailand. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of 12 haplotypes, with five haplotypes being represented in two or more populations, and the other seven being population-distinct haplotypes. Phylogenetic analysis by maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and neighbor joining analyses all placed the 12 haplotypes into two distinct and well-separated clades with high bootstrap support, reflecting the high sequence divergences between the clades (25.3-32.3%). The mountain ranges and the Isthmus of Kra are likely to have played important roles in hindering gene flow among H. rugulosus populations in Thailand. From the sequence divergence values, the two clades of H. rugulosus can be classified into two distinct species, and therefore, the strains of H. rugulosus bred in farm stocks should be restricted to a population of one clade so as to avoid cross breeding between the two clades.
