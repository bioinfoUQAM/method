Chronic hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection occurs in immunosuppressed adults. We detected HEV ribonucleic acid in serum of an adolescent patient who had undergone bone marrow transplantation and subsequently presented with persistently increased aminotransferases and histologic chronic hepatitis, and eventually developed cirrhosis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed these HEV strains were similar to swine genotype 3a, suggesting a possible zoonosis.
