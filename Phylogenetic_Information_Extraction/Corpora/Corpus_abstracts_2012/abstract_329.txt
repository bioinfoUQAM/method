To clarify the epidemiology of enterovirus 68 (EV68), which has been one of the most rarely identified enteroviruses, we carried out virus isolation and molecular screening using reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for 6,307 respiratory specimens collected at pediatric clinics in Yamagata, Japan between 2005 and 2010. We found 10, 1, 2, 0, 2, 40 EV68-positive cases in each year between 2005 and 2010. Fourteen virus isolation-positive cases were only from samples obtained in 2010. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that plural genetically distinct clusters co-circulated. These results suggest that the difficulty in EV68 isolation leads to an underestimation the occurrence of EV68 infections.
