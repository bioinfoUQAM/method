Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) is a causative agent of psittacine beak and feather disease. Genome sequences of BFDVs isolated from Thailand have not hitherto been reported. The whole genomes of 17 BFDV isolates, obtained from 12 psittacine genera, were amplified and subjected to direct sequencing revealing a length ranging from 1,990 to 2,015 nucleotides. The predicted open reading frames (ORFs) in the viral genome varied from four to six. Only ORF1, ORF2, and ORF5 were found in all isolates. Deduced amino acid sequences of BFDV ORF2 were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The phylogram grouped BFDV into ten clusters, which showed either host species relationship or regional restriction. The Thai isolates, were grouped into three clusters, cluster I, II, and V. Cluster I and II showed restricted geographical region to Thailand, and cluster II also showed a close relationship with BFDV isolated from Australia. Cluster V demonstrated neither restricted region nor species specificity of birds. In this cluster, there was an insertion of 16 nucleotides at non coding region of all BFDV isolates. The genetic information obtained from this study can be used to help understand BFDV diversity and evolution in Thailand.
