"A moderately thermophilic and strictly anaerobic bacterium, designated as HS1T, was isolated from offshore hot spring sediment in Xiamen of China. Cells were Gram-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative, slender and flexible rods without flagella. It could grow at 35-55'C (optimum at 50'C) and in 1-8% NaCl (w/v; optimum in 2-4%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain HS1T was affiliated with the family Marinilabiaceae and shared distant relationship with the previously described genera. The isolate was most closely related to Anaerophaga thermohalophila Fru22T with 16S rRNA gene sequence identity of 92.4%, followed by the other members of the family Marinilabiaceae with 88.7%-91.1% identity. The dominant cellular fatty acids are iso-C15:0 and anteiso-C15:0. The predominant quinone of the isolate was MK-7. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and an unknown polar lipid. The genomic DNA G+C content was 38.7 mol%. Besides the phylogenetically distant relationship, strain HS1T was obviously distinguished from the closest related genera in several phenotypic properties including colony color and pigment production, optimal temperature, optimal NaCl, relation to O2, bicarbonate/carbonate requirement, catalase activity, nitrate reduction, fermentation products and cellular fatty acids profile. Based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic data, strain HS1T represents a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Thermophagus xiamenensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HS1T (= DSM 19012T= CGMCCC 1.5071T)."
