"The prevalence rates of HCV and HIV were respectively 7.5% and 27.6%. Two thirds of the HCVinfected patients (20/30) were HIV-positive. Age, injecting drug use (IDU) and HIV status were factors inde- pendently associated with HCV infection. HCV RNA was detected in 23 serum samples; HCV RNA levels were measured in 22/23 samples. HCV RNA level was slightly higher in HCV-HIV co-infected patients than in HCV monoinfected patients. Genotypes 1 (n = 17) and 3 (n = 6) were determined by LiPA. Using phylogenetic tree analysis of the NS5B region, subtypes 1a (n = 12), 1b (n = 2) and 3a (n = 6) were identified."
