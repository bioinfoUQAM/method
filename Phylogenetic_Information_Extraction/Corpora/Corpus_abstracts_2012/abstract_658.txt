Bacteria producing volatiles with functions of nematode-attracting activities were isolated from 187 agricultural soil samples collected in 26 provinces of China with the method of double-Petri dishes. The phylogenetic diversity of these bacteria was characterized by RFLP-16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The nematode-attracting volatiles of bacteria were detected using the SPME-GC/MS, and volatile compounds with attractive activity were determined by confirming with individual commercial compounds.
