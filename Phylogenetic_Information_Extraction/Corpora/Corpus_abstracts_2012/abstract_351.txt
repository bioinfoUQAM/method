Pigeon pea witches'-broom phytoplasma group (16SrIX) is comprised of diverse strains that cause numerous diseases in leguminous trees and herbaceous crops, vegetables, a fruit, a nut tree, and a forest tree. At least 14 strains have been reported worldwide. Comparative phylogenetic analyses of the highly conserved 16S rRNA gene and the moderately conserved rplV (rpl22)-rpsC (rps3) and secY genes indicated that the 16SrIX group consists of at least six distinct genetic lineages. Some of these lineages cannot be readily differentiated based on analysis of 16SrRNA gene sequences alone. The relative genetic distances among these closely related lineages were better assessed by including more variable genes (e.g. rp and secY genes). The present study demonstrated that virtual RFLP analyses using rp and secY gene sequences allowed unambiguous identification of such lineages. A coding system was proposed to designate each distinct rp and secY subgroups, respectively, in the 16SrIX group.
