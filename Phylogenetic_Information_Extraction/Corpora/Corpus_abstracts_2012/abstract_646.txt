Mannanase-producing alkaliphilic bacterium HMTS15 was isolated by alkaline agar with konjak from water sample of Hamatai Lake in Inner Mongolia, China. The morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics and 16S rRNA gene were analyzed to identify the taxonomic position of strain HMTS15. Mannanase produced by strain HMTS15 was purified by four steps including (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, cellulose DEAE-sepharose, twice Superdex 200. The enzyme properties including optimal temperature, optimal pH, thermal stability, pH stability, NaCl tolerance, metal ion tolerance, EDTA and SDS tolerance were tested.
