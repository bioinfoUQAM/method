This paper describes two new species of Cotingacola Carriker, 1956, C. lutzae n. sp. and C. engeli n. sp., from the cinereous mourner Laniocera hypopyrra (Vieillot) and black-necked red cotinga Phoenicircus nigricollis Swainson (Aves: Passeriformes: Cotingidae), respectively. These species are fully illustrated and compared with their morphologically closest relatives. With the addition of these two new species, this Neotropical chewing louse genus now includes ten species. We also present records from Brazil for two previously described species, C. stotzi Clayton & Price, 1998 and C. parmipapillae Carriker, 1956. The re-examination of a specimen identified as 'Cotingacola sp.' in a recent phylogenetic study confirmed that it is C. parmipapillae and that Querula purpurata (Statius MAller) regularly hosts two Cotingacola species, which means that at least three cotingid hosts carry more than one species of Cotingacola. We comment on the variability in the host-specificity of Cotingacola species.
