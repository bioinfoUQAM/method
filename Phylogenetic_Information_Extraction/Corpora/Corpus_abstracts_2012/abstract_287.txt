During the examination of specimens of Theleporus and Grammothele (Polyporales, Basidiomycota) from tropical China, three new species, Theleporus membranaceus, T. minisporus and Grammothele denticulata, were identified based on both morphological and phylogenetic analyses. They are described and illustrated. T. membranaceus is characterized by its extremely thin basidiocarps (0.12 mm thick), small pores (7-10 per mm) and ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores. T. minisporus has the smallest basidiospores among the species in the genus. Grammothele denticulata is distinguished in the genus by grey pores, continuous hymenia over dissepiment edge and cylindric basidiospores with tapering apex. Two annotated identification keys are provided for species thus far accepted in Theleporus and Grammothele. The phylogenetic relationships of Theleporus and Grammothele were inferred based on nITS sequences, and are briefly discussed. The molecular evidence showed that Theleporus and Grammothele belong to the core polyporoid clade.
