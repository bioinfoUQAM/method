Among 626 samples, 148 were IFA positive (dilution_1:80). The overall seroprevalence was 23.6% (25.2% in New Caledonia, 17.5% in Vanikoro). Fifteen (8 men and 7 women, mean age 69 years) out of 148 DNA samples were found PCR positive. All ORF-K1 sequences belonged to KSHV genotype D. A geographic clustering according to the island of origin of KSHV infected persons was clearly observed with sequences from New Caledonia clustering with most Vanuatu strains.
