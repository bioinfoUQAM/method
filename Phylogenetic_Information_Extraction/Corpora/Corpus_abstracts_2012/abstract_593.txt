A taxonomic study was carried out on five Gram-staining-negative, catalase- and oxidase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria isolated from the gill and liver of five diseased rainbow trout. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the trout isolates belonged to the genus Chryseobacterium, exhibiting the highest similarity with Chryseobacterium oncorhynchi 701B-08T (98.9 % sequence similarity), C. ureilyticum F-Fue-04IIIaaaaT (98.6 %), C. indologenes ATCC 29897T (98.3 %), C. jejuense JS17-8T (98.1 %) and C. gleum ATCC 35910T (98.1 %). DNA-DNA hybridization values were 99-100 % among the five isolates and 21 and 57 % between strain 687B-08T, selected as a representative isolate, and the type strains of Chryseobacterium oncorhynchi 701B-08T, C. ureilyticum F-Fue-04IIIaaaaT and other phylogenetic related Chryseobacterium species. The predominant respiratory quinone of strain 687B-08T was MK-6 and the major cellular fatty acids were iso-C15:0, iso-C17:1 _9c, iso-C17:0 3-OH and C16:1 _6c. The G+C content of the chromosomal DNA of strain 687B-08T was 38.6 mol%. Based on the phenotypic and genotypic features, the novel bacteria isolated from rainbow trout were significantly different from the related Chryseobacterium species and, therefore, they were identified as representing a novel species of the genus Chryseobacterium, for which the name Chryseobacterium viscerum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 687B-08T (= CECT 7793T = CCUG 60103T).
