Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein family is a large protein family that protects other proteins from aggregation due to desiccation or osmotic stresses. A cDNA clone encoding a group 7 late embryogenesis abundant protein, termed PgLEA, was isolated from Pennisetum glaucum by screening a heat stress cDNA library. PgLEA cDNA encodes a 176 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 19.21'kDa and an estimated isoelectric point of 7.77. PgLEA shares 70-74% sequence identity with other plant homologs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PgLEA is evolutionarily close to the LEA 7 group. Recombinant PgLEA protein expressed in Escherichia coli possessed in vitro chaperone activity and protected PgLEA-producing bacteria from damage caused by heat and salinity. Positive correlation existed between differentially up-regulated PgLEA transcript levels and the duration and intensity of different environmental stresses. In silico analysis of the promoter sequence of PgLEA revealed the presence of a distinct set of cis-elements and transcription factor binding sites. Transcript induction data, the presence of several putative stress-responsive transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region of PgLEA, the in vitro chaperone activity of this protein and its protective effect against heat and salt damage in E. coli suggest a role in conferring abiotic stress tolerance in plants.
