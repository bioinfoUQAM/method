We investigated the presence of HBoV in nasopharyngeal secretions from children consulting for AlRTI and among asymptomatic controls, between 2007 and 2008, by polymerase chain reaction. Results: HBoV was detected in 79 (21.8%) of 362 nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from children with ARTI. In 60/79 (76%), coinfection with other respiratory viruses was confirmed. Most common symptoms were cough, fever and rhinorrhea. Children infected only with HBoV showed significantly lower frequencies of respiratory distress, oxygen requirements and hospital admission than those with coinfection. HBoV was detected in 6/16 (37.5%) samples from asymptomatic children. The phylogenetic analysis of viruses from Chilean patients revealed that circulating HBoV was closely related to original strains.
