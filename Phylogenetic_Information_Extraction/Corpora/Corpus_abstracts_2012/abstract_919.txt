MOTIVATION: Phylogenetic profiling methods can achieve good accuracy in predicting protein-protein interactions, especially in prokaryotes. Recent studies have shown that the choice of reference taxa is critical for accurate prediction, but with more than 2,500 fully sequenced taxa publicly available, identifying the most-informative reference taxa is becoming increasingly difficult. Previous studies on the selection of reference taxa have provided guidelines for manual taxon selection, and for eliminating closely related taxa. However, no general strategy for automatic selection of reference taxa is currently available. RESULTS: We present three novel methods for automating the selection of reference taxa, using machine learning based on known protein-protein interaction networks. One of these methods in particular, Tree-Based Search, yields greatly improved prediction accuracies. We further show that different methods for constituting phylogenetic profiles often require very different reference taxa sets to support high prediction accuracy.
