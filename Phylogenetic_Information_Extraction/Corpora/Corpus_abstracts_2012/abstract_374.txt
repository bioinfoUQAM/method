"Kotonkan virus (KOTV) and Obodhiang virus (OBOV) are rhabdoviruses that were isolated from arthropods in Africa and formerly classified as lyssaviruses. KOTV causes clinical bovine ephemeral fever in cattle; the ecology and pathogenicity of OBOV is poorly understood. In this paper, we report the complete genome sequences of KOTV and OBOV, their gene expression profiles, and their serological and phylogenetic relationships to other rhabdoviruses. The 15,870 nt KOTV genome (3'-l-N-P-M-G-G(NS)-_1-_2-_-_-_-L-t-5') is similar to that of bovine ephemeral fever virus but encodes an additional protein (_) that shares homology with the pleckstrin homology domain of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase. The 14,717 nt OBOV genome (3'-l-N-P-M-G-G(NS)-_1-_2-_-L-t-5') is similar to that of Adelaide River virus from which it is distinguishable serologically. In each virus, all ORFs, except _1 and _2, are transcribed as monocistronic mRNA. Genetic and serological data indicate that KOTV and OBOV should be classified as new species in the genus Ephemerovirus."
