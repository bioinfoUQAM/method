Nine avian influenza A viruses (AIVs), H1N2 (n'='2) and H1N3 (n'='7), were isolated from domestic ducks in live poultry markets in Zhejiang Province, Eastern China, in 2011. All viruses were characterized by whole genome sequencing with subsequent phylogenetic analysis and genetic comparison. Phylogenetic analysis of all eight viral genes showed that the viruses clustered in the Eurasian lineage of influenza A viruses. The hemagglutinin cleavage site of all viruses displayed features of a monobasic cleavage site. Although there was no evidence of re-assortment in subtype H1 AIVs among the avian species and mammalian hosts in this study, continued surveillance is needed considering the important role of the domestic duck in the dissemination and re-assortment of AIVs.
