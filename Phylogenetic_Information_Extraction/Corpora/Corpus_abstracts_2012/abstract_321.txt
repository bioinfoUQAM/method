Based on genetic and molecular analyses, the ABC model has been proposed to explain the genetic control of floral development. C-class MADS-box genes play crucial roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development by regulating the organ identities of stamens and gynoecium. The present research reports for the first time the cloning of an HpSHP gene from Hosta plantaginea (Lam.) Aschers. Phylogenetic analysis shows that HpSHP is a member of the C-class MADS-box genes that is closely related to C-lineage SHP homologues from monocot species. Semi-quantitative and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses show that HpSHP expression is stamen and gynoecium specific. HpSHP also has spatial and temporal expression patterns in the reproductive organs of H. plantaginea. A functional analysis is carried out in Arabidopsis by overexpression of HpSHP. Homeotic transformations of sepals into carpelloid organs, bent ovaries, and prematurely shattering fruits are observed in 35S::HpSHP transgenic plants. All these results show that HpSHP plays a crucial role in gynoecium development.
