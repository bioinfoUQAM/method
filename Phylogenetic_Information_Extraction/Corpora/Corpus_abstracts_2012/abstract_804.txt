"Strains P2 and P9 were identified as Paracoccus sp. and Shinella sp., respectively. Heterotrophic nitrification could occur by the strains when they utilized organics. After cultivation of 24 h, the ammonia removal rates by the strains were up to 80% approximately; meanwhile, there was almost no nitrite and nitrate accumulation. However, aerobic denitrification could not occur by the strains when NO3- or NO2- was provided as the sole nitrogen source, respectively. For heterotrophic nitrification, with strains P2 and P9, the optimal carbon source was sodium succinate, and the optimal C/N ratio was 9. Besides, the pH values rose from 6.8 to 8.9 in the whole ammonia removal process. The growth and nitrogen removal ability of the two strains depended much on the quantity of small molecule carbon source, and the nitrogen removal capability of strains P2 or P9 in wastewater with small molecule carbon source was improved evidently. The effect was strengthened especially when the two strains were mixed together."
