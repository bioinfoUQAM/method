Introduction Human T-lymphotropic virus type1 (HTLV-I) is an important global health problems in the world mainly in the endemic areas of HTLV-I infection. It has previously reported that northeast of Iran, Mashhad, is a new endemic region of HTLV-I. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of HTLV-I in Sabzevar, located in the south east of Mashhad. Materials and Methods In this cross-sectional study 1445 individuals were selected by multistage cluster sampling. Serum samples were screened for anti HTLV-I antibody using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and all of the ELISA positive samples were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Long terminal repeat (LTR) sequencing was carried out to determine the type of HTLV-I in Sabzevar. Results In the primary screening by ELISA, 26 /1445(1.8%) were reactive for HTLV-I antibody. Twenty four out of 26 samples were confirmed HTLV-I infection by PCR (24/1445). The overall prevalence of HTLV-I infection in Sabzevar is 1.66%). The prevalence of the virus infection in men and women was 2.42% (11/455) and 1.31% (13/989), respectively. Seroprevalence was associated with age, increasing significantly among those older than 30 years (p=0.015), and a history of surgery (p=0.002), imprisonment (p=0.018), and hospitalization (p=0.005). Three out of 24 positive HTLV-I samples were selected for sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of LTR. The results showed HTLV-I in Sabzevar belonged to cosmopolitan subtype. Conclusion The present study showed Sabzevar is a new endemic area for HTLV-I infection. Our study highlights the important of systemic HTLV-I screening of blood donors in Sabzevar and other city of Khorasan province should be taken into account.
