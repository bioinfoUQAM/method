"Choanoflagellates are closely related to metazoans and fungi according to recent phylogenetic studies; therefore the systematics of these organisms is of particular interest. The choanoflagellate morphospecies Codosiga botrytis is the first described choanoflagellate, and is one of the most frequently reported choanoflagellate species. In this study we present phylogenetic and morphological data on eight different strains of Codosiga botrytis. Among these there are five ancient strains; these cultures have been established from up to 43,000 years old cysts from Siberian permafrost. We found that based on the variable V4 region of the small subunit (SSU) of the rDNA, all the investigated freshwater isolates of Codosiga botrytis, together with Sphaeroeca volvox, form a cluster at the base of all other choanoflagellate species. Moreover, the morphospecies described classically as Codosiga botrytis contains at least four different genotypes separated by considerably high genetic distance. All these 'cryptic species' have identical general morphology and cell structure. Strains have a similar life cycle with several different life forms and large morphological plasticity. For the first time we were able to establish cultures from cryo-conserved cysts of choanoflagellates. The ancient strains did not differ significantly in partial SSU rDNA from the modern ones. Besides, no biogeographically pattern could be established. This fact and the low genetic distances of some strains from remote locations support the distribution of dormant stages via air."
