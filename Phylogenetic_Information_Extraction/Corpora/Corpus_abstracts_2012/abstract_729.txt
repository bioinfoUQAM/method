"Genetic analysis of pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1; H1N1pdm09) virus was undertaken to understand virus evolution during 2009 and 2010 in India. Surveillance of influenza viruses from July 2009 to December 2010 revealed major peaks of circulating H1N1pdm09 viruses in August-September and December-January 2009 and then in August-September 2010. To understand the diversity of the H1N1pdm09 virus, selected specimens (n_=_23) from 2009 or 2010 were characterized by nucleotide sequence determination of the HA1 subunit of the HA gene. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 22 clustered with clade 7 viruses characterized by S203T mutations, whereas one virus from 2010 fell within clade 6. None of the viruses from either 2009 or 2010 formed a monophyletic group, suggesting a continuum of independent introduction of circulating viral strains. Amino acid analysis revealed minor amino acid changes in the antigenic or receptor-binding domains. Importantly, we observed mutations that were also present in 1918 pandemic virus, which includes S183P in 4 and S185T mutation in 3 of 13 viruses analyzed from 2010, while none of the 2009 viruses carried these mutations. Whether antibody-mediated pressure is imposing such changes remains to be determined. Continued genetic surveillance is warranted to monitor pathogenicity as the virus evolves to acquire new features."
