Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of platelet-activating factor (PAF). A homolog of alpha subunit of PAF-AH(Ib) from Antheraea pernyi (GuCrin-MCneville) (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) (ApPAFAHIb_) was isolated and characterized. The obtained cDNA sequence was 1843 base pairs (bp) long with an open reading frame (ORE) of 678 bp encoding 225 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence shared several conserved features of PAF-AHs of other organisms, and revealed 88, 60, and 46% identity with the homologues of Bombyx mori, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that lepidopteran PAFAHIb_s including ApPAFAHIb_ might be a new member of the PAF-AHs family of insects. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the ApPAFAHIb_ gene was transcribed at four developmental stages and expressed in all tissues tested.
