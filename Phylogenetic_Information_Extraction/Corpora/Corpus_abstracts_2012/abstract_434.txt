In this study, we used a population genetic approach with microsatellite markers to attempt to clarify the species boundary of Acropora corals. Species in this taxon are usually difficult to distinguish with the usual molecular phylogenetic approach. We used Acropora sp. 1 and Acroporadigitifera as the target species to shed light on the species boundary of Acropora at the population level. These species are morphologically and ecologically similar but are reproductively isolated by differences of a few months in their spawning seasons. We could not distinguish these species using a phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial control region, as previously reported in other Acropora species. In contrast, a population genetic approach clearly distinguished these species both sympatrically and allopatrically. Our results suggest that recent speciation and shared ancestral polymorphisms could partly explain the para- and polyphyly of several Acropora species.
