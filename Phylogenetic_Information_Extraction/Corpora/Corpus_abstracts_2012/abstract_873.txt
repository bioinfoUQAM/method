Five strains of bifidobacteria were isolated from faeces of a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and a red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas). The five isolates clustered inside the phylogenetic group of the genus Bifidobacterium but did not show high sequence similarities between the isolates and to known species in the genus by phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Sequence analyses of dnaJ1 and hsp60 also indicated their independent phylogenetic positions to each other in the Bifidobacterium cluster. DNA G+C contents of the species ranged from 57.3 to 66.3mol%, which is within the values recorded for Bifidobacterium species. All isolates showed fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase activity. Based on the data provided, the five isolates represent five novel species, for which the names Bifidobacterium reuteri sp. nov. (type strain: AFB22-1(T)=JCM 17295(T)=DSM 23975(T)), Bifidobacterium callitrichos sp. nov. (type strain: AFB22-5(T)=JCM 17296(T)=DSM 23973(T)), Bifidobacterium saguini sp. nov. (type strain: AFB23-1(T)=JCM 17297(T)=DSM 23967(T)), Bifidobacterium stellenboschense sp. nov. (type strain: AFB23-3(T)=JCM 17298(T)=DSM 23968(T)) and Bifidobacterium biavatii sp. nov. (type strain: AFB23-4(T)=JCM 17299(T)=DSM 23969(T)) are proposed.
