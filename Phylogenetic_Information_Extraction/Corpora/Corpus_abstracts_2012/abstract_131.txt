"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) share the same transmission routes which lead to high coinfection rates. Among HIV-infected individuals such rates reached 21% in Argentina, being HCV-1a the most predominant subtype. In this work, 25 HCV subtype 1a (HCV-1a) strains from Argentinean patients coinfected with HIV were studied based on E2 and NS5A sequences. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that 12 strains were highly related to each other, constituting a highly supported (posterior probability_=_0.95) monophyletic group that we called ""M."" The remaining HCV strains (group dispersed or ""D"") were interspersed along the phylogenetic trees. When comparing both groups of HCV-1a, 10 amino acid differences were located in functional domains of E2 and NS5A proteins that appeared to affect eventually the peptides binding to MHC-I molecules thus favoring immune escape and contributing to the divergence of HCV genotypes. Bayesian coalescent analyses for HCV-1a cluster M isolates indicated that the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) overlaps with the age estimated recently for the HIV-BF epidemic in Argentina. Furthermore, the genomic characterization based on pol gene analysis from HIV viremic patients showed that most HIV isolates from patients coinfected with HCV-1a cluster M were BF recombinants with identical recombination patterns. In conclusion, these results suggest the presence of an HCV-1a monophyletic cluster with a potential HIV co-transmission by phylogenetic analyses. J. Med. Virol. 84:570-581, 2012.
