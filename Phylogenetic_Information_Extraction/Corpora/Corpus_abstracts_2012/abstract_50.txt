The Gal*pagos archipelago has never been connected to any continental land masses, so it is of interest to know the colonization and diversification history of its endemic species. We analyzed the phylogenetic placement of the endemic Gal*pagos flycatcher, M. magnirostris, within Myiarchus by using the genes ND2 and cytb (1970bp) to compare 16 of the 22 species that comprise this genus. We also analyzed variability in cytb sequences from 154 M. magnirostris individuals captured on seven Gal*pagos islands. Our phylogenetic analyses recovered the two main Myiarchus clades that had been described by previous genetic, morphological, and vocal analyses. M. magnirostris is monophyletic and its closest living relative is M. tyrannulus from Mexico and Central America. The average age for the split node between these two groups was approximately 850,000years (95% C.I. 630,735-1,087,557). M. tyrannulus, M. nugator, M. nuttingi, M. sagrae, and M. stolidus are not monophyletic species. Within M. magnirostris itself, we found low nucleotide and haplotype diversities (_=0.0009 and h=0.4913, respectively) and a high genetic structure among populations. We also detected a star-shaped haplotype network and significantly negative values for Tajima's D and Fu's Fs for this species. Our results suggest that M. magnirostris originated from a single colonization event and had a recent population expansion in the Gal*pagos archipelago.
